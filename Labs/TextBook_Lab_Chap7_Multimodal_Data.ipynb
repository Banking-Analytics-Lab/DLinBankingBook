This gathering comes a few weeks after the announcement\\nof this year's stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the highlights of those results.\\nThey show that our financial system remains resilient and that capital planning by banks\\ncontinues to improve. The largest and most complex banks were tested against a severe\\nhypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well above their minimum\\nrequirements. They demonstrated the ability to withstand a severe and lasting economic\\ndownturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses. Additionally, most firms are\\nnow meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure capital planning takes into account\\ntheir specific risks and vulnerabilities. This is an improvement from last year. Overall, these\\nresults are good news that confirm our financial system is significantly stronger than before the\\ncrisis.\\nNow let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our understanding of the\\nexperience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to think about the future. And let\\nme begin by acknowledging that-notwithstanding our openness to learning from the collective\\nexperience of all of us in this room-the future of stress testing will, in a number of important\\nways, necessarily resemble the past. For example, we're still going to have them. Over the\\ncourse of the last 18 months, I have heard overwhelmingly-from academics, from think tanks of\\nevery stripe, from banks of every size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreign-\\nthat stress tests should continue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve's supervision of\\nsystemically important banks and a key aspect of the Fed's efforts to promote financial stability.\\nStress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic. And the banks' performance on these\\ntests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the affected\\nbanks' capital requirements.\\nTransparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental principle of the\\nfirst stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a primary goal. Stress tests,\\nas ever, will provide the public with essential information to assess the health of banks and the\\noverall financial system. To be credible, stress tests will also continue to provide significant\\ninformation about how the Fed does its work, so the public can understand the rigor and\\nindependence of our assessment process and how we come to our judgment of the firms we\\ntest.\\nFidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress test a decade\\nago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn't changed over the\\nyears. We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and added useful features and\\nadjustments. These include a counterparty default scenario, as well as a number of policy\\nstatements that more explicitly convey the principles we find important in a sensible stress\\ntesting program.\\nStress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as supervisors learn\\nfrom our work and what we can learn from others. Each year, we have refined both the\\nsubstance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own experience and by critiques\\nand suggestions from others. This feedback comes from a variety sources, including\\nconferences such as this one, and I am confident that the presentations today will provide\\ninsights that result in improvements in our stress tests.\\nIf stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that they must\\ncontinue to change: they must respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and the\\nrisk-management capabilities of firms. Evolutionary change has been a consistent principle of\\nstress testing since the beginning, embraced by my predecessors at the Board of Governors\\nand our supervisory staff and reflected in each cycle of tests. Without such adjustments,\\nregulators, banks, and the broader public cannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital\\npositions of the largest banks.\\nStress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around the capital\\nadequacy of our largest banks. Stress tests results should allow investors, counterparties,\\nanalysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the condition of banks. Along with\\nother regulatory measures, this transparency increases market discipline and it subjects the\\nFederal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and analysis. Accountability is important not only for\\nthe usual reasons that apply in a democracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only\\nbe effective when the public has confidence in the Fed's evaluation of the capital adequacy of\\nbanks. In effect, stress tests are also a test of the Fed's supervision of large banks.\\nIn these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk management, the\\neconomy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to stress tests over the past\\ndecade. Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which is a founding principle for\\nstress tests. I will then suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of stress testing can be\\nfurther enhanced with greater transparency.\\nTen years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the first stress\\ntest results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP). At that moment, the\\nU.S. economy was in free fall. The United States had lost an astonishing three million jobs in the\\nprevious four months. One significant reason for these losses was that many businesses were\\nseverely constrained in their access to funding and found it impossible to predict when that\\naccess might improve. The goal of the first test was urgent and simple: to restore confidence in\\nthe 19 large banks that then accounted for two-thirds of the assets in the banking system. In fact,\\nsimply announcing in March that there would be tests helped stabilize bank finances. That\\nimprovement continued after the results in May outlined the quite feasible steps for raising\\nadditional capital that the banks would need to take, and did take, to be able to continue lending if\\nadverse conditions continued. Challenging conditions did continue, but the stress tests and other\\nactions taken in the first half of 2009 marked a turning point. The recovery from the Great\\nRecession began in July, as the financial system came back to life, and then steadily\\nstrengthened.\\nThe principles that made that first test so effective were independence and transparency. For the\\nfirst time, an independent authority, the Federal Reserve, would seek to independently assess\\n1\\nrisks. Just as important, the details of that assessment would be shared with the public, an\\nextent of transparency that until then wasn't characteristic of bank supervision but would become\\nthe hallmark of the regulatory framework erected in response to the crisis. The first tests relied\\nheavily on banks' internal risk models, but they still represented a huge step in independence in\\nproviding the public with an assessment of the health and resiliency of large banks.\\nTransparency facilitated both market discipline and accountability. The information provided to\\nthe public under the SCAP stress test reinforced the entire enterprise of estimating the capital\\nshortfall faced by major banks. It held the banks accountable for information on their capital\\nadequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.\\nThe next big step for stress testing came with its integration with the Federal Reserve's\\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning in 2011. One big change from\\nthe initial SCAP test was that stress tests were no longer a one-time emergency measure\\nintended to restore confidence in major financial institutions. Instead, they became a recurring,\\nongoing process intended to maintain confidence in major institutions. Second, stress tests were\\nno longer a discretionary exercise by supervisors-under Dodd-Frank, they became the law of\\nthe land. And third, when they were integrated into CCAR, stress tests became part of a\\ncomprehensive-it's the first C in CCAR-framework for capital planning that more closely\\nconnected capital regulation to risk management of banks and overall supervision.\\nThese were changes, but with the effect of reinforcing the founding principles of the SCAP test.\\nTransparency was enhanced when stress tests became mandatory, recurring events and the\\npublic could depend on continuing to have access to information about banks' capital adequacy.\\nAlso, the independence of those judgments was enhanced when Congress made them a\\nstatutory responsibility for the Fed and when they were integrated into our CCAR framework.\\nFurther changes to stress testing have likewise reinforced the original goals. Stress testing\\nscenarios have become richer and more challenging, providing more information about how\\nbanks would deal with a range of adverse developments and, for example, exploring the effects\\nof more differentiated risks that are not tied to the business cycle. Large trading banks now face\\nan instantaneous shock to their trading assets, and many participants in the stress tests now\\nmust address how they would respond to the failure of their largest counterparty.\\nOur stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand a severe\\nrecession. The capital-building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete, but as part of\\nCCAR, stress testing continues to contribute to the significant and ongoing improvement since\\n2009 in risk management by banks. The original reason for the qualitative objection aspect of\\nstress testing was to provide incentives for banks to address the risk-management\\nshortcomings that the Federal Reserve had observed during the financial crisis. For example,\\nmany firms supervised by the Federal Reserve had substantial deficiencies in their ability to\\nmeasure, monitor, and manage their risks. These shortcomings made it difficult for banks to\\naccurately report their risk exposures to the Board, and consequently, threatened to undermine\\nthe credibility of the stress tests, which were, and remain, dependent on data from the banks.\\nSince the beginning of CCAR in 2011, large banks have significantly improved their\\nriskmanagement and capital-planning processes. The qualitative assessment conducted as part of\\nthe 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles found that most firms either meet or are very close to meeting\\nthe Federal Reserve's supervisory expectations for capital planning. Large banks have improved\\nthe methods they use to identify their unique risks, now use sound practices for identifying and\\naddressing model weaknesses, and have strong processes in place to evaluate their capital\\npositions on a forward-looking basis. While we continue to perform a qualitative assessment and\\nensure that progress is retained, the improvements led the Federal Reserve to conclude that for\\nmost banks this assessment can be incorporated into our regular supervisory practices. The\\nevolution of our qualitative assessment reflects the experience of the past 10 years of stress\\ntesting, and in particular, the great improvement in risk management by large banks and the\\ncumulative effect of the Fed's improved supervision of large institutions. As I said earlier, for\\nstress testing to remain effective, it must respond to changes in the economy, the financial\\nsystem, and risk-management capabilities.\\nThe changes to CCAR have occurred in the context of a similarly dramatic improvement in the\\nstrength and resilience of the financial system. The firms have more than doubled their capital\\nsince the first round of stress tests in 2009. Since that time, the common equity of the largest 18\\nfirms has increased by more than $650 billion.\\nLet me now turn to the most recent changes to CCAR and stress testing and put them in the\\ncontext of the history I have just related. Congress revisited large bank supervision last year in S.\\n2155, yet the legislation it passed reaffirmed the important role of stress testing. This shouldn't\\nbe surprising, because the experience of stress testing over the last 10 years has demonstrated\\nthat it is a highly useful element of large bank supervision and the promotion of financial stability.\\nSomething else that shouldn't be surprising is that this experience has revealed that periodic\\nstress testing has turned out to be a less useful supervisory tool to evaluate the risks of smaller\\nand less complex financial institutions. Congress made use of this experience by raising the\\nthreshold for stress testing to $100 billion in assets and providing more flexibility for the Fed to\\ntailor stress testing for all firms. This step has, once again, advanced the principles\\ndemonstrated in the first stress test and ever since. It has increased transparency because\\nincorporating and disclosing what we have learned about the varying effectiveness of stress\\ntesting at different types of institutions is making stress testing more effective. The accountability\\nof the Fed is enhanced when we are seen taking on board what we have learned through\\nsuccessive cycles of stress tests, and this strengthens the independence and credibility of our\\njudgments. For those of us who believe stress testing should remain central to supervision and\\npromoting financial stability, it is vital that an adjustment such as this takes place as appropriate.\\nWith that in mind, let me review recent changes and proposed changes to the Federal Reserve's\\nstress testing. These changes are designed to make CCAR more transparent and simple and to\\nfeature less unnecessary volatility.\\nThe first principle is transparency. We have taken a number of recent steps to enhance the\\ntransparency around our models and the stress testing process more generally. Earlier this year,\\nthe Board published enhanced disclosures on two of the key models that we use in stress\\ntesting. In addition, the Board published estimated loss rates for groups of loans with distinct\\ncharacteristics, to show how supervisory models treat specific assets under stress. We will\\npublish disclosures about two additional models in 2020 and each year thereafter until we have\\nprovided transparency about all our stress test models. At the same time, we published a new\\npolicy statement on our approach to supervisory stress testing. Among other things, the\\nstatement emphasizes the importance of independence and stability to the credibility of our\\nstress tests.\\nWe are currently considering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and\\nscenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and\\npossible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and salient risks facing the\\nbanking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the\\nscenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios, and a range of other\\nenhancements.\\nSome argue that the greater transparency and disclosure promoted by recent changes and\\n2\\nproposed changes to stress testing amounts to providing banks with the answers to the tests.\\nThis both overstates the extent of disclosure involved and misunderstands what we are trying to\\naccomplish in stress testing-goals that haven't changed since the spring of 2009.\\nIf the goal were only to conduct a test that was difficult to pass-like the qualifying exams for\\nsome of the more esoteric and restrictive high-IQ societies-then trying to explain principles,\\nscenario design, and how models work would be inappropriate. If the measure of success for the\\nFed in administering a stress test was simply how many banks failed, then greater transparency\\nwould indeed be a mistake. But that is not the purpose of stress testing, and it never has been.\\nThe vitally important goal is to improve and sustain good risk management and capital planning\\nat the individual institutions we supervise and to promote the stability of the financial system. Like\\na teacher, we don't want banks to fail, we want them to learn. In this case, we want them to learn\\ngood risk management in the context of forward-looking capital planning. This will provide the\\npublic with more information about the capital planning of major banks, and about how the\\nFederal Reserve views good capital planning and risk management, bolstering our credibility.\\nThe second principle reflected in recent changes to stress testing is simplicity. One important\\nproposal-what we are calling the stress capital buffer-would simplify the Fed's large bank\\ncapital rule by integrating the stress testing process with our traditional regulatory capital rules.\\nOur regulatory capital rule includes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on\\ntop of those minimum requirements. The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to\\nsupervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the\\nminimum requirements. Integrating these two standards is a natural evolution of CCAR away\\nfrom its origins during the crisis, when such tailoring was impractical and policy makers had not\\nyet considered the approach of a regulatory capital buffer on top of a regulatory capital minimum.\\nThe stress capital buffer would result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory\\ncapital requirements because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.\\nThe stress capital buffer would not reduce the stringency of the regulatory capital framework for\\nlarge banks, but it would effect a substantial simplification of that framework. By my math, the\\nnumber of different capital requirements applicable to large banks would fall from 18 to eight and\\nthe number of different total loss absorbing capacity requirements for large banks would fall from\\n24 to 14. I expect that we will move forward with a revised stress capital buffer proposal in the\\nnear future, reflecting many of the comments received on our original proposal.\\nThe third principle addressed by the recent changes is volatility. When I think about volatility in\\nstress testing, I want to distinguish what I consider to be useful variation in the tests, in the form\\nof exploration of salient risks, from what I consider to be less useful variation, in the form of\\nunexpected swings in capital requirements that don't have any particular relationship to changing\\nrisks at individual firms. In addition, one source of volatility in the tests comes from the fact that\\nbanks are forced to do their capital planning before they get the results of our tests. I will address\\neach of these concerns in turn.\\nIn distinguishing useful from less useful volatility, one option to address the year-over-year\\nvolatility of the tests would be to average the results of the tests from the previous year or years.\\nThis would not affect the overall stringency of the tests but, mathematically, would mean that no\\nsingle year could have an outsized influence on the amount of capital that a bank is required to\\nmaintain. The potential downsides to this approach include the reduced risk sensitivity that a\\nbank may experience to a particular test and potential technical challenges associated with\\nchanges to a bank's balance sheet and earnings. Bearing in mind these potential challenges, I\\nbelieve more thinking and discussion of this issue would be fruitful.\\nWith respect to the second concern, as I have said before, I believe it more rational and logical\\nfor firms to be able to plan for their capital needs with the benefit of the results of our tests. Given\\nthe huge strides that the banks have made in their capital planning and in meeting our\\nexpectations, I view the risk of banks backsliding in this regard to be minimal because it would be\\nevident in the next test. Our capital-planning expectations will not decline, and we will continue to\\nuse the supervisory process to enforce these expectations. It is my hope that greater\\ntransparency can play a role in other parts of our supervisory process-for example, by allowing\\nother aspects of bank supervision to benefit from public input. Greater transparency for\\nsupervision is in keeping with one of the biggest improvements to the regulatory framework and\\nto stress testing since the financial crisis. I believe the changes and proposed changes to stress\\ntesting that I have discussed today reinforce the founding principles of the first test, administered\\nin the challenging and uncertain spring of 2009, and reflect what we have learned each year over\\nthe decade since then. That process of learning and refining should and must continue in order\\nto keep stress tests as relevant and effective as they have been in helping to reduce the chances\\nof another severe crisis.\\nbanking firms' assets,\\\" Journal of Financial Economics 71, no.3 (2004): 419-60.\",\n          \"Daniel K Tarullo: Regulating large foreign banking organizations\\nSpeech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\\nSystem, at the Harvard Law School Symposium on \\\"Building the Financial System of the\\nTwenty-first Century: An Agenda for Europe and the United States\\\", Armonk, New York,\\n27 March 2014.\\n* * *\\nThe financial crisis exposed, in painful and dramatic fashion, the shortcomings of existing\\nregulatory and supervisory regimes. In both the United States and the European Union (EU),\\nthe crisis also revealed some particular vulnerabilities created by foreign banking operations.\\nThis evening I would like to focus on these vulnerabilities and on how best we should\\naddress them.\\nLet me note at the outset the now commonplace observation that we have a quite integrated\\ninternational financial system, with many large, globally active firms operating within a\\nsystem of national government and regulation or, in the case of the EU, a hybrid of regional\\nand national regulation. I add the equally commonplace observation that there is no realistic\\nprospect for having a global banking regulator and, consequently, the responsibility and\\nauthority for financial stability will continue to rest with national or regional authorities.1 The\\nquestion, then, is how responsibility for oversight of these large firms can be most effectively\\nshared among regulators. This, of course, is the important issue underlying the perennial\\nchallenge of home-host supervisory relations.\\nAnother introductory observation is that - at least in a world of nations with substantially\\ndifferent economic circumstances, different currencies, and banking and capital markets of\\nquite different levels of depth and development - there will be good reason to vary at least\\nsome forms of regulation across countries. Presumptively, at least, nations should be able to\\nadjust their regulatory systems based on local circumstances and their relative level of risk\\naversion as it pertains to the potential for financial instability. Although the financial systems\\nand economies of the United States and the EU are more similar to one another than they\\nare to those of many other jurisdictions, they are hardly identical. Even between these two,\\nfor example, there may be legitimate differences within the broader convergence around\\nminimum regulatory and supervisory standards developed at the Basel Committee, the\\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions, the Financial Stability Board, and\\nother forums.\\nThese opening observations are important in responding to the curious charge of\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" that has been levelled at the United States and, to a lesser extent, some\\nother jurisdictions, as a result of actions taken or proposed in response to problems\\npresented by foreign banks during the crisis. I say \\\"curious\\\" for several reasons. One is that\\nthe charge reflects a misunderstanding of the allocation of responsibility between home and\\nhost supervisors that has evolved in the Basel Committee during the past several decades.\\nAnother is that the charge seems implicitly, and oddly, premised on the notion that what we\\nhad in 2007 was a well-functioning, integrated global financial system with effective\\nconsolidated supervision of global banks. A third is that the charge overlooks the fact that\\nmuch of what the United States is now doing is matching what the EU has quite sensibly\\nbeen doing for years.\\nIn the rest of my remarks I will elaborate on these points, though not in the spirit of a\\ndebater's arguments, but in an effort to answer the question I posed a moment ago: How,\\nthat is, can we successfully reduce the risks to financial stability posed by large,\\ninternationally active banks? As I hope will become apparent, a theme I wish to emphasize is\\nthat we need to redouble efforts at genuine supervisory cooperation if we are to manage\\neffectively the vulnerabilities and challenges posed by the perennial home-host issue.\\nInternational principles on home- and host-country responsibilities\\nWhile the circumstances and risks may have changed, the issue of the appropriate roles of\\nhome and host countries is not a new one. Indeed, it was a key motivation for creation of the\\nBasel Committee in 1975 following the failures of the Herstatt and Franklin National banks.\\nMany of the Basel Committee's early activities were focused on the challenges created by\\ngaps in the supervision of internationally active banks, as evidenced by the fact that Basel\\n\\\"Concordats\\\" on supervision preceded Basel \\\"Accords\\\" and \\\"Frameworks\\\" on capital and\\nother subjects. This task has, of necessity, been ongoing, as experience revealed gaps in\\nsupervisory coverage and as the scale and scope of internationally active banks grew. The\\nprinciple of consolidated supervision emerged in the early 1980s to ensure that some specific\\nbanking authority - generally the home-country regulator - had a complete view of the\\nassets and liabilities of the bank.2 This principle was reinforced and elaborated following the\\nBank of Credit and Commerce International episode in the early 1990s.3\\nIt is important to note that each Basel Committee declaration on the importance of\\nhomecountry consolidated oversight has also included a statement of the obligations and\\nprerogatives of host states in which significant foreign bank operations are located. This\\nfeature of the Basel Committee's approach makes sense as a reflection both of the host\\nauthority's responsibility for stability of its financial system and of the practical point that a\\nhost authority will be more familiar with the characteristics and risks in its market. In\\naccordance with this history, the current version of the \\\"Core Principles for Effective Banking\\nSupervision\\\" sets out as one of its \\\"essential criteria\\\" for home-host relationships that \\\"[t]he\\nhost supervisor's national laws or regulations require that the cross-border operations of\\nforeign banks are subject to prudential, inspection and regulatory reporting requirements\\nsimilar to those for domestic banks.\\\"4\\nIt is clear, then, that consolidated supervision is not intended to displace host-country\\nsupervision. Instead, as the Basel Committee has regularly noted, the two are intended to be\\ncomplementary, so as to assure effective oversight of large, internationally active banks.\\nSimilarly, the stated purpose of the Basel Committee in requiring consolidated capital\\nrequirements is not to remove from host countries any responsibility or discretion to apply\\nregulatory capital requirements, but to \\\"preserve the integrity of capital in banks with\\nsubsidiaries by eliminating double gearing.\\\"5 Likewise, and contrary to suggestions that are\\nsometimes made, the capital accords and frameworks developed by the Basel Committee\\nhave always been explicitly minimum requirements. They are floors, not ceilings.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in establishing a post-crisis framework for domestic\\nsystemically important banks (D-SIBs), the Basel Committee made clear that a host country\\nmay in appropriate circumstances designate domestic operations of a foreign bank as\\nsystemically important for that country, even if the parent foreign bank has already been\\ndesignated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).6 The idea informing the newly\\ncreated concept of a D-SIB is that an entity whose stress or failure could destabilize a\\ndomestic financial system might thereby indirectly destabilize the international financial\\nsystem. Thus, the D-SIB category carries along with it higher loss-absorbency requirements\\nthan are generally applicable to domestic banks, although perhaps not as high as\\nrequirements for G-SIBs. Of course, our regulation for foreign banking organizations (FBOs)\\ndoes not entail D-SIB designation or require higher than generally applicable loss\\nabsorbency. But I cite this feature of the D-SIB framework that permits designation of the\\ndomestic operations of foreign G-SIBs because it reflects rather clearly the principle that the\\nspecific characteristics of domestic markets may call for regulation of foreign banks in the\\nhost country, not just at a consolidated level.\\nIn short, the work of the Basel Committee over the years has not been directed at restraining\\nhost-country authorities from supervising and regulating foreign banking operations in their\\ncountry. On the contrary, the committee has repeatedly asserted the complementary\\nresponsibilities of both home and host countries to oversee large, internationally active\\nbanking groups, in the interests of both national and international financial stability. And the\\ncommittee has frequently returned to this set of issues in responding to developments that\\npose a threat to the safety and soundness of the international financial system.\\nThe shift in foreign bank activities\\nUnfortunately, neither the Basel Committee nor national regulators responded in a timely\\nfashion to the magnitude of the expansion in scale and scope of the world's largest banking\\norganizations in the roughly 15 years before the financial crisis. As illustrated in figure 1, at\\nthe end of 1974, just before the Basel Committee was created, the assets of the world's\\n10 largest banking organizations together equaled about 8 percent of global GDP. The three\\nlargest were all American - BankAmerica, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan. But their\\ncombined assets were equal to less than 3-1/2 percent of world GDP and, as illustrated in\\nfigure 2, about 10 percent of the GDP of their home country, the United States. By 1988 the\\ncombined assets of the world's 10 largest banking organizations as a proportion of world\\nGDP had nearly doubled to about 15 percent, a ratio that held constant during the\\nsucceeding decade, at the beginning of the emerging market financial crisis in 1997.\\nThen the explosive growth began. In the next decade - that is, up to the onset of the financial\\ncrisis in 2007 - the combined assets of the world's 10 largest banks as a share of global\\nGDP nearly tripled, to about 43 percent. The largest bank in the world at that time, Royal\\nBank of Scotland (RBS), had assets equivalent to about 6.8 percent of global GDP, nearly\\ntwice the comparable figure for the three largest banks combined in 1974. Adding the assets\\nof Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas - the second and third largest banks in 2007 - to those\\nof RBS, the three had combined assets equal to about 17 percent of global GDP. And each\\nof the three had assets nearly equal to, or in one instance substantially more than, the GDP\\nof its home country. Even the eighth-ranked bank, UBS, had assets well over four times the\\nGDP of its home country, Switzerland.\\nNot only did the size of the largest banks change dramatically, so, too, did their scope,\\nreflecting the overall integration of capital market and traditional lending activities that\\naccelerated in the decade and a half preceding the crisis. This trend was particularly\\napparent in the United States and the United Kingdom, homes to the world's two largest\\nfinancial centers. In the United States, the proportion of foreign banking assets to total U.S.\\nbanking assets has remained constant at approximately one-fifth since the late 1990s. But\\nthe concentration and character of those assets have changed noticeably. Today there are\\nas many foreign as U.S.-owned banks with at least $50 billion in U.S. assets, the threshold\\nestablished by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for banks\\nfor which more stringent prudential measures must be established.7 Perhaps even more\\nimportant was the shift in composition of foreign bank assets in the 15 years before the crisis,\\nwith the proportion of assets held in the U.S. broker-dealers of the 10 largest FBOs rising\\nfrom approximately 15 percent to roughly 50 percent.8 Today, 4 of the top 10 broker-dealers\\nin the United States, and 12 of the top 20, are owned by foreign banks.\\nMeanwhile, even the traditional branching model of large foreign commercial banks in the\\nUnited States had changed. Reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased\\nsignificantly. Many foreign banks shifted from the \\\"lending branch\\\" model to a \\\"funding\\nbranch\\\" model, in which U.S. branches of foreign banks were borrowing large amounts of\\nU.S. dollars to upstream to their parents. These \\\"funding branches\\\" went from holding\\n40 percent of foreign bank branch assets in the mid-1990s to holding 75 percent of foreign\\nbank branch assets by 2009. Foreign banks as a group moved from a position of receiving\\nfunding from their parents on a net basis in 1999 to providing significant funding to non-U.S.\\naffiliates by the mid-2000s - more than $600 billion on a net basis by 2008.9\\nA good bit of this short-term funding was used to finance long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated\\nproject and trade finance around the world. There is also evidence that a significant portion\\nof the dollars raised by European banks in the pre-crisis period ultimately returned to the\\nUnited States in the form of investments in U.S. securities. Indeed, the amount of U.S.\\ndollardenominated asset-backed securities and other securities held by Europeans increased\\nsignificantly between 2003 and 2007, much of it financed by the short-term,\\ndollardenominated liabilities of European banks.10\\nJust as regulatory systems did not, in the years preceding the crisis, address vulnerabilities\\nsuch as reliance on short-term wholesale funding that were created by the integration of\\ncapital markets and traditional lending, so they did not respond to the transformation of\\nforeign banking operations. Accordingly, just as home countries of systemically important\\nbanks have been playing catch-up on capital, liquidity, and other requirements, so host\\ncountries of very large foreign banking operations are playing catch-up in dealing with the\\nvery different character of many internationally active banks from that of 20 or 30 years ago.\\nThe regulatory response\\nIn a sense, the major strengthening during the past few years of capital and liquidity\\nrequirements for internationally active banks - including the capital surcharge for banks of\\nglobal systemic importance - has to date been the most important international regulatory\\nresponse to the revealed vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations.\\nBuilding capital and improving the liquidity positions of banks on a consolidated basis is\\nsurely a key step toward assuring the stability of major FBOs in host countries.\\nOf course, these agreed changes have not yet been fully implemented. It is critical not just\\nthat all jurisdictions adopt appropriate regulations that fully incorporate the new Basel\\nstandards, but also that we ensure our banks will be substantively, and not just formally,\\ncompliant as the various transition target dates are reached. It is also the case that there is\\nmore to be done in addressing the risks posed by large global banking organizations,\\nincluding additional measures to deal with the run risks associated with short-term wholesale\\nfunding and ensuring that even the largest firms can be successfully resolved without either\\ncreating major systemic problems or requiring an infusion of public capital. I will return to\\nthese subjects a bit later, in discussing the cooperative agenda that lies ahead for the United\\nStates, Europe, and our partners throughout the world.\\nFirst, though, I want to describe how Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States are\\ndealing with the vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations, and thus are\\nfulfilling their responsibilities as host-country supervisors. I discuss the United Kingdom\\nseparately from the EU both because it is outside the euro zone and because, as a host\\njurisdiction, it is more similar to the United States than to other EU member states or, indeed,\\nto any other country in the world.\\nThe EU has not, since the crisis, specifically adjusted the structure of regulation of foreign\\nbanks by its member states in their role as host supervisors. For more than a decade before\\nthe crisis, EU member states had prudently required that not only commercial banking, but\\nalso investment banking subsidiaries of foreign (non-EU-based) banking organizations, be\\nsubject to Basel capital requirements in the same way as EU-based firms. With the adoption\\nof CRD IV,11 the directive implementing the new EU capital requirements, Basel III will now\\nbe applied to all EU firms, including EU bank and investment bank subsidiaries of non-EU\\nbanking organizations. Branches of non-EU banks are generally not subject to local\\nrequirements.\\nBefore the crisis and the subsequent development of Basel III, there was no leverage ratio\\nrequirement in EU capital directives. Insofar as a new leverage ratio is part of the Basel III\\npackage agreed upon internationally, one would anticipate that it will be applied to\\ncommercial banking and investment banking firms in the EU, again including local\\nsubsidiaries of non-EU firms. Likewise, one would anticipate that the Basel III liquidity\\nrequirements will be implemented in the EU in accordance with the internationally agreed\\ntimeline and, again, that it will apply to EU subsidiaries of FBOs.\\nA greater challenge for the EU has been dealing with banks headquartered in one EU\\ncountry but doing business in other EU countries under the \\\"single passport,\\\" which basically\\nallows for full access in the rest of the EU, with supervision provided only by the home\\ncountry. During the crisis, there were some notable instances of banking stresses and\\nfailures involving such institutions, with consequent negative effects on depositors,\\ncounterparties, and economies in other parts of the EU. Much of the ongoing post-crisis\\nreform agenda in Europe seems directed at ensuring the safety and soundness of EU-based\\ninstitutions. The most important of these changes may be the assumption by the European\\nCentral Bank of supervisory responsibility for larger euro area banks. And, as we saw just\\nlast week, work continues on the long process of creating a credible resolution mechanism\\nfor those banks.\\nAs a member state of the EU, the United Kingdom of course implements the EU policies I\\nhave just described. But that country has applied an additional set of requirements on the\\nlocal operations of foreign banks, particularly with respect to liquidity. The Prudential\\nRegulation Authority of the Bank of England applies local liquidity requirements to\\ncommercial and investment banking subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks, requiring them to hold\\nlocal buffers as determined by internal stress tests with both 14- and 90-day components.\\nThe assumptions on which the stress tests are premised are quite strict. For example, the\\nU.K. subsidiary generally must assume zero inflows from non-U.K. affiliates - even for claims\\non non-U.K. affiliates with short terms that mature within the stress test period - and\\n100 percent outflows to non-U.K. affiliates. The requirements generated by the test are\\nsubject to a supervisory review and add-on that for some firms has resulted in a significant\\nincrease in the buffer requirement. Branches of foreign commercial banks may in some\\ncircumstances be subject to local liquidity requirements as well.\\nThe U.K. initiative in applying local liquidity requirements is wholly understandable in light of\\nthe difficulties encountered because of stress on foreign institutions, including the Lehman\\nbankruptcy, during the crisis. Because London is one of the world's two largest financial\\ncenter hosts, the United Kingdom is the only country other than the United States hosting\\nnumerous, very large broker-dealers that are owned by foreign banks and also a broad array\\nof commercial bank subsidiaries and branches that are owned by foreign banks. In fact, the\\nsix institutions headquartered outside the United States and the United Kingdom that are in\\nthe top three tiers of G-SIBs hold roughly 40 percent of their worldwide assets in those two\\njurisdictions.12 Thus the U.K. initiative on liquidity and its internal debates on matters such as\\nstructural supervision, the Vickers proposals, and stress testing have all been very instructive\\nfor the Federal Reserve Board. Even where we have eventually adopted somewhat different\\napproaches, we respect the motivation and scrupulousness of the U.K. banking authorities in\\naddressing the systemic vulnerabilities posed by FBOs and in fulfilling their responsibility to\\nthe rest of the world to assure the stability of one of the world's two most important financial\\ncenters.\\nUnlike the EU, the United States did not - prior to the financial crisis - require that all\\nbrokerdealers and investment banks meet Basel capital standards. The legacy of the\\nGlassSteagall Act, which had separated investment banking from commercial banking, meant that\\nonly commercial banks were subject to the prudential regulation of the federal banking\\nagencies. In Europe, the dominance of universal banking, or variants thereon, led more\\nnaturally to application of capital and other prudential standards to all forms of banking\\nactivity. Even after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the remaining barriers to affiliation\\nbetween investment banks and commercial banks in the United States, Basel capital\\nrequirements applied at a consolidated level to the activities of an investment bank or\\nbrokerdealer only if it did affiliate with a commercial bank. Thus, the five large \\\"free-standing\\\" U.S.\\ninvestment banks were generally not subject to full application of Basel capital standards.\\nDuring the crisis, the ill-advised nature of this regulatory state of affairs became apparent.\\nThe decline in value of many mortgage-backed securities and the consequent market\\nuncertainty as to the true value of that entire class of securities raised questions about the\\nsolvency of major broker-dealers. Because the dealers were so highly leveraged and\\ndependent on short-term financing, the uncertainty also led to serious liquidity strains, first at\\nBear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and eventually at most dealers - domestic and foreign\\nowned. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were acquired by existing bank holding companies\\nafter coming close to failure. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan\\nStanley became bank holding companies.\\nThrough its Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Federal Reserve provided substantial liquidity\\nto the broker-dealer affiliates of the bank holding companies, as well as to the primary dealer\\nsubsidiaries of foreign banks. At the same time, the shift in strategy of many foreign banks\\ntoward using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around the\\nworld created another set of vulnerabilities that resulted in substantial and, relative to total\\nassets, disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve's discount window by foreign bank\\nbranches.\\nThe experience of the crisis made clear, first, that the perimeter of prudential regulation\\naround U.S. financial institutions needed to be expanded. As noted a moment ago, this had\\noccurred de facto during the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act has given a legal foundation for this\\nchange, first by mandating that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will remain subject to\\nconsolidated prudential regulation even were they to divest their insured depository\\ninstitutions and, second, by giving the Financial Stability Oversight Council the authority to\\ndesignate other financial firms as systemically important, a step that would place them under\\nFederal Reserve regulation and supervision. Dodd-Frank further required the Federal\\nReserve to apply progressively more stringent prudential regulation to bank holding\\ncompanies with more than $50 billion in assets.\\nCongress also required the Federal Reserve to apply special prudential standards to large\\nFBOs. As I have already implied, much of what we have done is simply to catch up to EU\\nand U.K. practice. Under our recently finalized Section 165 enhanced prudential standards\\nregulation, an FBO with U.S. non-branch assets of $50 billion or more must hold its U.S.\\nsubsidiaries under an intermediate holding company (IHC), which must meet the risk-based\\nand leverage capital standards generally applicable to bank holding companies under U.S.\\nlaw.13 Such an FBO must also certify that it meets consolidated capital adequacy standards\\nestablished by its home-country supervisor that are consistent with the Basel Capital\\nFramework. FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must also meet liquidity\\nrisk-management standards and conduct internal liquidity stress tests. The IHC must\\nmaintain a liquidity buffer in the United States for a 30-day liquidity stress test. The U.S.\\nbranches and agencies of an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal\\nto the liquidity needs for 14 days, as determined by a 30-day liquidity stress test.14 The IHCs\\nof FBOs must also conform to certain risk-management and supervisory requirements at the\\nIHC level.\\nStructurally, the U.S. capital requirements for FBOs are similar to those that apply to foreign\\nbanks in the EU. That is, generally applicable Basel capital requirements are applied to the\\nU.S. operations of FBOs that own local banking subsidiaries, investment banks, and\\nbrokerdealers. In fact, the new U.S. rules are somewhat more favorable to foreign institutions, in\\nthat they only apply once the non-branch U.S. assets of an FBO exceed $50 billion. That\\ndollar amount, incidentally, is the same as the Dodd-Frank threshold for more stringent\\nprudential measures, though note that this statutory threshold applies if the total assets of\\nany U.S. banking organization - foreign, as well as domestic - exceed that level. As in the\\nEU, the capital requirements do not apply to U.S. branches of foreign banks, even though the\\ncrisis experience provides some credible arguments for doing so.\\nThe leverage ratio requirement has received particular attention. One complaint is that the\\nforeign operations of U.S. banks are not subject to leverage ratios for their local operations. It\\nis true that many foreign countries - including the EU member states - do not currently have\\nleverage ratio standards for their banks. As noted earlier, however, one may reasonably\\nexpect that those countries will be implementing the Basel III leverage ratio in a timely\\nfashion. Also, I would note in passing that the U.S. leverage ratio requirement for foreign\\nfirms will be phased in more slowly than originally proposed, so as to align it more closely\\nwith the effective date of the Basel III leverage ratio requirement.\\nA second complaint is that there is something unfair about the United States requiring an\\nFBO to meet the international leverage ratio in its U.S. operations, because its operations\\nmay be heavily weighted toward broker-dealer activities, which generally have higher\\nleverage, whereas the leverage ratio for U.S. firms is based on their global operations. Again,\\none suspects that the foreign operations of U.S. firms could be subject to a similar ratio\\nrequirement abroad as countries implement their Basel III commitments. However, quite\\napart from what may happen in the future, there are two U.S.-based firms - Goldman Sachs\\nand Morgan Stanley - whose global business mix resembles that of the U.S. subsidiaries of\\nFBOs that are predominantly engaged in broker-dealer activities in the United States. In fact,\\nunder the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio the Board proposed during the summer,\\nthese and other U.S. G-SIBs would be subject to a higher Basel III leverage ratio\\nrequirement (5 percent) than would apply to FBO IHCs (3 percent).\\nThe applicable liquidity requirements, while somewhat differently defined, are roughly\\ncomparable to those already applicable to FBOs in the United Kingdom. The similar positions\\nof our two nations as host countries for foreign bank operations heavily involved in trading\\nand significantly reliant on potentially runnable short-term wholesale funding explain this\\nrough parallelism.\\nThe most notable departure of the new U.S. FBO standards from existing EU and U.K.\\npractice lies in the IHC requirement for foreign banks with large domestic operations. Given\\nthe structure of U.S. financial regulation that is a legacy of Glass-Steagall, as well as the\\nefforts by a small number of very large foreign banks to evade the intent of Congress that\\ncapital standards apply to their U.S. operations, we needed to create this structural\\nrequirement. It is unclear how much difference this makes for the capital requirements of\\nFBOs in the United States as opposed, say, to those of U.S. operations in the EU. That\\nwould depend on the existence and size of financial affiliates owned by the U.S. firm that are\\nnot subject to Basel standards directly. In any case, it seems sound prudential practice - and\\nconsistent with the various Basel Committee principles to which I earlier referred - that large\\ndomestic operations of foreign banks meet capital standards on the basis of all exposures in\\nthe host jurisdiction and, indeed, that they manage their risks in that country across all their\\naffiliates.\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" and home-host responsibilities\\nTo return to the issue of Balkanization, three things should now be apparent. First, in its new\\ncapital regulations applicable to FBOs, the United States is more a follower of the pattern set\\nby the EU than it is an initiator of new kinds of requirements. Of course, a few foreign banks\\nwould prefer the old system under which they held relatively little capital in their very\\nextensive U.S. operations. But that was neither safe for the financial system nor particularly\\nfair to their competitors - U.S. and foreign - that hold significant amounts of capital here.\\nIndeed, a firm that is genuinely well capitalized, including holding the G-SIB surcharge at its\\nglobal consolidated level, should require only moderate adjustment efforts during the\\ntransition period established in the FBO rule.\\nSecond, there is considerable scope for a foreign bank to integrate its U.S. operations with\\nits global activities within the rule the Federal Reserve adopted last month. For example,\\nwhile foreign firms with more than $10 billion in non-branch assets have some additional\\nreporting requirements, only when U.S. non-branch assets rise above $50 billion do the\\nquantitative Basel capital requirements become applicable to the U.S. subsidiaries.\\nMoreover, no capital requirements apply to branches so long as their parent is subject to\\nhome-country consolidated capital rules consistent with Basel standards. The U.S.\\noperations of FBO branches and subsidiaries will not be subject to \\\"due from\\\" restrictions.\\nThey remain free to lend money to their worldwide affiliates; they must simply do so with a\\nmore stable funding base. Finally, I note that many FBOs, like many U.S.-based banks, have\\nmade considerable progress in reducing dependence on short-term wholesale funding and in\\nbuilding capital. To some extent, the new requirements are intended to preserve this\\nprogress.\\nThird, the capital and liquidity requirements that do apply are wholly consistent with the\\nresponsibility of host-country supervisors to assure financial stability in their own markets.\\nCollectively, foreign banks with a large presence in the United States conduct activities of a\\nscope, and at a scale, that could lead to problems for the U.S. financial system should they\\ncome under stress. Realistically, exposures and vulnerabilities in a large host-country market\\nare much more difficult for home-country supervisors to assess. Indeed, U.S. regulators\\ncount on the expertise and proximity of U.K. regulators in overseeing the London operations\\nof large U.S. financial institutions to enhance the effective consolidated supervision and\\nregulation for which we are responsible.\\nOn the issue of home-host-country coordination in regulating large, globally active banking\\norganizations, I would make three additional points. First, our FBO capital requirements, like\\nthose of the EU for foreign commercial and investment banks, are based on the capital rules\\nagreed to in the Basel Committee.15 Thus, there is an overall compatibility between national\\nand international rules with respect to applicable definitions, standards, and required ratios.\\nSecond, home countries must implement and enforce faithfully at a consolidated level these\\nsame capital rules. More broadly, home-country supervisory expectations for strong\\nconsolidated capital levels, liquidity positions, and risk-management practices are likely to\\nfacilitate compliance with domestic requirements for large FBOs of the sort applicable in the\\nUnited States and the EU. It is also important that home countries assure the credibility of\\nresolution mechanisms for their large banking organizations. This task entails the\\nimplementation of the Financial Stability Board's principles for effective resolution regimes,\\nincluding establishing a resolution authority with adequate legal powers to manage the\\nprocess in an orderly fashion without injection of public capital.16 It also includes requiring\\neach such institution to have total loss absorption capacity sufficient to recapitalize the firm\\neven if its substantial equity buffer is lost in an extreme tail event. Home and host countries\\nshould work together toward international standards that will ensure that an appropriate\\namount of this capacity would be available to host authorities faced with the potential\\ninsolvency of large FBOs in their jurisdiction or with the consequences for their market of the\\nfailure of parent banks.\\nIn this regard, I think that capital requirements for FBOs of the sort now required by the EU\\nand the United States are very likely to reduce the considerable strains that have traditionally\\naccompanied financial distress at global banking firms. In most cases, including both\\ninternationally and within the EU itself in recent years, stress has resulted in the demand by\\nhost authorities for ex post ring fencing of capital, liquidity, or both, often in the absence of\\nany ex ante requirements. The existence of FBO capital and liquidity standards, particularly if\\nsupplemented with the total loss absorbency measures to which I just referred, should\\nmitigate the need for such demands, which of course come at the worst possible time for the\\nfirm trying to meet them.\\nThird, we - by which I mean both home and major host banking regulators - need to find\\nbetter ways of fostering genuine regulatory and supervisory cooperation. Particularly at the\\nmost senior levels of the agencies that actually supervise globally active banks, our\\ninteractions with our counterparts from other countries have become almost exclusively\\nfocused on developing international standards or reviewing compliance with existing ones.\\nThese discussions are usually conducted with numerous colleagues who are not themselves\\nresponsible for banking regulation in their own jurisdictions. As important as these efforts\\nhave been, and continue to be, following the crisis, there is a risk that by not having\\nopportunities for senior officials of the various national agencies that have direct supervisory\\nresponsibility for banking organizations to meet and discuss shared challenges, we give\\nshort shrift to the collective interest of bank regulators in effective supervision of all globally\\nactive firms. Proposals to include prudential requirements or, more precisely, to include\\nlimitations on prudential requirements in trade agreements would lead us farther away from\\nthe aforementioned goal of emphasizing shared financial stability interests, in favor of an\\napproach to prudential matters informed principally by considerations of commercial\\nadvantage.\\nConclusion\\nThe job of regulating and supervising large, globally active banking organizations is a tough\\none. Issues of moral hazard, negative externalities, and asymmetric information are, if not\\npervasive, then at least significant and recurring. The job is made only harder by the fact that\\nthese firms cross borders in ways their regulators do not. But we cannot ignore this fact and\\npretend that we have global oversight. International standards for prudential regulation are\\nnot the same as global regulations, and consolidated supervision is not the same as\\ncomprehensive supervision. The jurisdictions represented on the Basel Committee not only\\nhave the right to regulate their financial markets - including large FBOs participating in those\\nmarkets - they have a responsibility to their home jurisdictions, and to the rest of the world,\\nto do so. The most important contribution the United States can make to global financial\\nstability is to ensure the stability of our own financial system.\\nThere must be some assurance beyond mere words from parent banks or home-country\\nsupervisors that a large FBO will remain strong or supported in periods of stress. After all, as\\nwe saw in the crisis, while a parent bank or home-country authorities may have offered those\\nwords with total good faith in calm times, they may be unable to carry through on them in\\nmore financially turbulent periods. None of this means that we need be at odds with one\\nanother. On the contrary, these very circumstances call not only for more tangible\\nsafeguards in host countries, but also for more genuine cooperation among supervisory\\nauthorities. Indeed, as I hope will continue to be the case with the international agenda on\\nresolution, total loss absorbency, and related matters, we should aspire to converge around\\nthe kinds of protections that we can expect at both consolidated and local levels.\\nBIS central bankers' speeches 11\",\n          \"William C Dudley: The national and regional economic outlook\\nRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal\\nReserve Bank of New York, at the University at Albany, Albany, New York, 18 November 2011.\\n* * *\\nGood morning. I am pleased to be at the University at Albany. It is always a pleasure to\\nspeak with students and faculty because of the intellectual leadership role you play in your\\ncommunities. I also welcome the addition of business leaders to this gathering because you\\nshape the economic landscape in the region. So, I thank you all for coming today and helping\\nmake this such a rich audience.\\nOver the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across\\nmy Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to\\nWashington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international\\nbank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure\\nthat my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As\\nyou may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in\\nnorthern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\nIn August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark,\\nPatterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and\\nPuerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\\nMy trip started yesterday with a policy speech to the West Point cadets and was followed by\\na colloquium with their economics faculty. So, this visit to the upper Hudson Valley brings me\\nin contact with some of our country's future leaders - you and the cadets who will lead our\\ncountry in very important, if different, ways.\\nI will also have a chance to see more of what makes Albany so distinct from both downstate\\nand Upstate New York. Of course, I may have a leg up on this because I was born and\\nraised close by, in western Massachusetts!\\nThe greater Albany area is home to 900,000 people - roughly the size of three average cities\\nin the United States. You and your fellow residents tend to be highly educated and be\\nemployed as public servants. These factors are all part of what makes Albany feel special.\\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed - what we do and why we do it. Then I'll\\ngive you my views on the economy nationally and locally. It's a serious issue because it\\naffects your family and students' job prospects at graduation time.\\nWhat the New York Fed does\\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my\\njob so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily\\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as\\nthe FOMC.\\nI am vice chair of the FOMC - a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in\\nWashington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The\\nmembers of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by\\nCongress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.\\nSometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should\\nview this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions - particularly at times like this -\\nand we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are\\nunited in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential\\nto the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term\\npolitical pressures.\\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region\\nand the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical\\ninformation that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils\\nand community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. This trip includes\\nmeetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global Foundries (an advanced\\nmicroprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic Development Council, and the\\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a\\nnumber of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of\\neconomic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are\\nessentially local measures of output - similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the\\nnational level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the\\nemployment report, which is the only other available metric at the state level. We have also\\nstarted a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount\\nand type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a\\ntimely way.\\nIn addition, we have a new poll about credit and financing for small businesses, the latter are\\nan important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and\\nreasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011\\npoll, of which nearly 15 percent were from the upstate region. The next poll will be in\\nJanuary. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll,\\nplease pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\\nNext month, we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses\\n- to provide information about how they can participate in the global economy and expand\\ntheir companies by exporting their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small\\nBusiness Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce will be on hand. They will\\ntell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government\\nprograms are available to enhance credit, reduce payment risk and increase lines of working\\ncapital. We are also facilitating a \\\"speed mentoring\\\" forum in which small businesses will\\nreceive feedback on their business plans and advice about applying for financing from a\\nrange of finance professionals.\\nIn 2012, we're planning similar events in the capital region. We hope to partner with many of\\nyou to support the small business sector.\\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we\\ntarget some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked\\nhard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we\\nhave provided housing advocates, including the Empire Justice Center, with the latest\\ninformation on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters.\\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit\\nnewyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business,\\ncredit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our\\ncolleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial\\nsystem on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at\\nit. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual - whether on\\nthe part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\\nNational economic conditions\\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\\nWe stand here today several years after the worst financial crisis in modern times. The\\norigins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had\\ngrown to great size during the middle part of the last decade.\\nPrior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and imbalanced\\nglobal economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide. This was particularly\\nextreme in certain markets such as U.S. housing and housing finance.\\nThis mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive build-up of debt\\nin many parts of the global economy. Many - though not all - U.S. households responded to\\nthe easy availability of credit and rising home prices by taking on more debt. When the\\nhousing boom lost steam and began to burst, expectations about housing prices and wealth\\nwere disappointed. The bursting of the credit bubble also created instability within the global\\nfinancial system and, this, in turn resulted in a sharp drop in the credit available to\\nhouseholds and businesses.\\nThe result was what is now called the \\\"Great Recession\\\". Over the period from late 2007\\nthrough mid-2009, real GDP declined by more than 5 percent, making this recession the\\nlongest and deepest recession of the postwar period.\\nThe recession was felt in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe impact it\\nhad on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the recession, contributing to a\\nsharp rise in the unemployment rate from around 4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over\\n10 percent in October 2009.\\nExtraordinary actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve,\\nprevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy stabilized\\naround mid-2009. But since then the recovery has been bifurcated. While emerging\\neconomies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown only slowly. This has\\nhastened a historic shift in the balance of economic power that was already underway before\\nthe crisis.\\nIn the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than expected.\\nGrowth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment significantly or to achieve a\\nself-reinforcing cycle of strengthening confidence, demand, income and employment.\\nAlthough the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from\\nearlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very weak first half,\\nwhen GDP growth was less than 1 percent, economic activity has strengthened somewhat\\nand inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated\\nto be 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be\\nsomewhat higher. This modest rebound reflects in part the passing of transitory factors such\\nas the damping effect on household and business spending power from rises in energy and\\nfood prices as well as the supply disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\\nHowever, as we look toward 2012, the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to\\na robust recovery. Accordingly I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012.\\nConsumer price inflation has begun to moderate. This moderation is just starting to become\\nevident on a 12-month time horizon - in which consumer price inflation as measured by the\\nconsumer price index (CPI) is rising at about a 3.5 percent annual rate. Given current\\nexpectations for the path of energy prices - taken from futures markets - consumer price\\ninflation on a year-over-year basis should continue to fall over the next few months.\\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few\\nyears. The economy is operating far below its productive potential - leaving the level of\\noutput, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy's unused\\nresources were put to work. One summary statistic says it all - the unemployment rate is\\nunacceptably high at 9 percent. Given my outlook, the decline of unemployment over the\\nnext year is likely to be modest. Furthermore, we also continue to face significant downside\\nrisks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\\nIn a speech yesterday at West Point, I highlighted the need for our nation to deploy a full set\\nof economic policy tools to secure the recovery and build for the long term. This includes\\nmonetary policy, but also requires policies to help repair housing markets, fiscal policy that\\nsupports growth in the short and long run, and structural reforms that increase\\ncompetitiveness and support a shift in the pattern of economic activity toward a more\\nsustainable growth path than that which prevailed during the last business cycle upswing.\\nRegional economic conditions\\nHow is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York\\nFed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor conditions in New York State.1\\nBased on our index, the downturn in the state's economy ended in November of 2009. Since\\nthen, I would describe the state's economy as recovering at a moderate pace, although there\\nappears to have been a pause in September.\\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to learn about\\nconditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that November's report (issued\\nthis Tuesday) shows signs of stabilizing after five months of weakening. In November, more\\nmanufacturers are adopting an optimistic outlook.\\nLike many other large states, New York has a bifurcated economy. New York's downstate\\narea differs dramatically from the upstate area in terms of industrial composition, occupations\\nand job growth. While Albany may be geographically midway between the two areas, its\\nindustry mix resembles neither the downstate's heavy concentration in the service sector, nor\\nthe upstate focus on the manufacturing sector. What sets Albany apart is that it is home to\\nthe state's capital. About one quarter of employees in the Albany area work for the\\ngovernment - about a third more than the statewide average.\\nThe local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this recession, but\\nthe impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well established. During the downturn,\\nthe capital region saw a loss of about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment,\\nconsiderably less severe than the 6.5 percent nationwide decline. Over the past year and a\\nhalf, job losses have slowed. But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently\\nsay that a solid recovery is underway. The Albany area is not yet consistently adding jobs.\\nThis is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced by New York State. The state\\nhas cut a considerable number of government jobs and reduced other expenditures as part\\nof its effort to close significant budget gaps. These job reductions have disproportionately\\nslowed Albany's local economy.2\\nIn contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany's private sector is showing signs of recovery.\\nYour private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to offset the public\\nsector job losses. However, this job creation has not been robust enough to bring down the\\nunemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent of the workforce. That is a lower rate of\\nunemployment than the national rate, as is usual for Albany. However, it is almost double the\\njobless rate in early 2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended. It will be\\ndifficult for growth in the region's economy to resume and for unemployment to decline until\\nthe public sector stabilizes.\\nAn important plus for the local economy is the capital region's housing sector, which has\\nweathered the economic storm relatively well. As a result, the drop-off in economic activity\\nthat is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not\\nbeen as severe here as it has been in many other places around the country. Like much of\\nUpstate New York, Albany's housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of\\nthe country. During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany's house prices rose by 85 percent,\\nmuch higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate New York as a whole\\nand almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen nationally. Unlike the rest of the\\nnation, though, the region's housing market has been comparatively stable since then. Prices\\nhave declined by about 7 percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of\\n32 percent nationally.\\nNonetheless, declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased\\nfinancial pressures on families. During the recession, all across the nation, high levels of debt\\nled to a soaring number of delinquencies. Many families found that they needed to reduce\\ntheir debt to more sustainable levels.\\nDrawing on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that these\\ntrends have certainly affected people in this area.3 But the good news is that the effects have\\nnot been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country. Households in the Albany\\nregion did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest of the state and\\ncountry during the run-up to the crisis. Recent data indicate that the average adult in Albany\\nhas about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20 percent lower than the average across the\\nstate and country as a whole. Thus, financial strains on many families in the Albany area\\nwere lower than in many other places around the state and nation.\\nHowever, the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the area,\\nso it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures. About 4 percent of debt\\nbalances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany, which is twice the 2 percent delinquency\\nrate in 2005. Although this is less than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this\\ndoubling of delinquencies in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress\\nfor many families here.\\nStepping back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of\\nfundamental strengths. These strengths show through in some key ways:\\n\\uf0b7 Albany is growing. The recent Census shows that the population in the region\\nexpanded by 5.5 percent over the past decade, more than double the statewide\\naverage. Saratoga County saw an especially strong gain of nearly 10 percent.\\n\\uf0b7 Incomes in the region are high. Albany is the state's most affluent area outside the\\nNew York City metropolitan region. Median household income was roughly $57,000\\nin 2009, moderately above the statewide median and well above the nation's. Not\\nsurprisingly, then, the poverty rate is lower than the U.S. average - 11 percent\\nversus 14 percent nationally.\\n\\uf0b7 Your residents are highly educated. Educational attainment - a critically important\\ndriver of economic activity - is also well above the national average. A third of adults\\nwho live in the Albany area hold college degrees.\\nOne of Albany's key strengths is its higher education industry. The colleges and universities\\nin the capital region help stabilize the local economy during downturns and recoveries.\\nIndeed, the private education sector continually added jobs before, during, and after the\\nGreat Recession, both nationally and locally. For example, the University at Albany has\\ntaken a lead role in shaping the next generation of financial professionals and regulators\\nthrough its pioneering curriculums. From my perspective at the Fed, a particularly important\\nand timely example is the University's innovative National Science Foundation-supported\\nprogram for instruction and research in financial market regulation.\\nResearch conducted by the New York Fed has shown that colleges and universities can help\\nbuild the skills and education of their region's workforce, which is critical to an area's ultimate\\neconomic success.4 They do this in two ways. Most directly, colleges and universities support\\nan educated workforce by producing new college graduates, some of whom will stay and\\nwork in the area. The University at Albany clearly plays this role in the capital area.\\nPerhaps equally important in terms of promoting local economic growth, colleges and\\nuniversities can play a key role in creating jobs for skilled workers in local businesses.\\nColleges and universities conduct research and development that can have \\\"spillover effects\\\"\\ninto the local economy. Businesses in the region can take advantage of being close to these\\ninnovative activities and facilities to develop new products and technologies. This can also\\nhelp draw new companies to the region to access university resources. Thus, successful\\nindustry-higher education partnerships can provide a quite a boost for a region's economy.\\nThe local nanotech sector provides an excellent example of this type of partnership at work.\\nDuring my visit to the University's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering this\\nafternoon I look forward to seeing the facilities and hearing more about the Center's plans to\\nlead the way in global nanotech research. More broadly, I understand that our audience\\ntoday includes several members of the Regional Economic Advisory Council - including the\\nUniversity at Albany's president, George Philip and Michael Castellana, the co-chair of the\\nCouncil - who are working to advance such partnerships and the outlook for the region.\\nGoing forward, the industry-higher education partnerships taking place here will be\\nincreasingly important. I expect the strong foundation already in place will help maintain the\\neconomic vitality of the capital region.\\nConclusion\\nTo sum up, growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to\\nbring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the\\nfinancial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which\\nhas risen in recent months, is poised to moderate soon.

The economy has\\nmade considerable progress toward these objectives over the past year.\\nWhile inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) objective\\nof 2 percent, it has eased substantially, and the slowing in inflation has occurred without\\na significant increase in unemployment. As labor market tightness has eased and\\nprogress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation\\ngoals have been moving into better balance.\\nEven so, the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks and is acutely aware\\nthat high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet\\nthe higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. The FOMC is\\nstrongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Restoring price\\nstability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that\\nbenefit all.\\nI will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.\\nCurrent Economic Situation and Outlook\\nEconomic activity expanded at a strong pace over the past year. For 2023 as a whole,\\ngross domestic product increased 3.1 percent, bolstered by solid consumer demand\\nand improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the\\npast year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have\\nbeen weighing on business fixed investment.\\nThe labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have\\ncontinued to come into better balance. Since the middle of last year, payroll job gains\\nhave averaged 239,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has remained near\\nhistorical lows, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an\\nincrease in the supply of workers, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54, and a\\ncontinued strong pace of immigration. Job vacancies have declined, and nominal wage\\ngrowth has been easing. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand\\nstill exceeds the supply of available workers. The strong labor market over the past two\\nyears has also helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings\\nacross demographic groups.1\\nInflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above the FOMC's\\nlongerrun goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4\\npercent over the 12 months ending in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy\\ncategories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent, a notable slowing from 2022 that was\\nwidespread across both goods and services prices. Longer-term inflation expectations\\nappear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of\\nhouseholds, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.\\nMonetary Policy\\nAfter significantly tightening the stance of monetary policy since early 2022, the FOMC\\nhas maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent\\nsince its meeting last July. We have also continued to shrink our balance sheet at a\\nbrisk pace and in a predictable manner. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is\\nputting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.\\nWe believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the\\neconomy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back\\npolicy restraint at some point this year. But the economic outlook is uncertain, and\\nongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. Reducing\\npolicy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have\\nseen in inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2\\npercent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly\\nweaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the\\ntarget range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving\\noutlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be\\nappropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that\\ninflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.\\nWe remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to\\nkeeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is\\nessential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over\\nthe longer run.\\nTo conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and\\nbusinesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We\\nat the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment\\nand price stability goals.\\nThank you.

Bowman\\nMember\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\nat the\\nHarvard Law School Faculty Club\\n\\nCambridge, Massachusetts\\n\\nMarch 5, 2024\\n\\nThank you for the invitation to join you this evening at Harvard Law School.' It is an\\nhonor and a pleasure to speak to this distinguished group. To kick off our conversation, I would\\nlike to frame the discussion by offering my views on a key element underpinning the U.S. bank\\nregulatory framework: the role of tailoring. While the principle itself is simple-setting\\nregulatory priorities and allocating supervisory resources in a risk-based way-the consequences\\nof tailoring (or not) can reverberate throughout the banking system, the broader U.S. financial\\nsystem, and the economy. I see a clear nexus between tailoring and fidelity to the law, including\\na targeted focus within our statutorily mandated prudential responsibilities.\\n\\nTailoring as a Grounding Principle\\n\\nI have long been a proponent of tailoring and continue to consider it a strong foundational\\nprinciple upon which to apply bank regulation and supervision. This approach ensures a focus\\non the most critical risks over time, avoiding the over-allocation of resources or imposition of\\nunnecessary costs on the banking system. When we approach rulemaking with a commitment to\\ntailoring, and to our broader prudential mandates, the public can judge our actions by how well\\nthey serve these ends, and they should rightly be concerned when regulatory actions seem to\\nserve other goals. In this sense, tailoring keeps policymakers grounded and facilitates\\nappropriate prioritization. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to\\nmost effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability.\\n\\nIn accordance with the law, the Federal Reserve, both in its monetary policy function and\\nin the execution of its bank regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, is meant to operate\\n\\nindependently and apolitically. But banking regulators have a responsibility to act in a way that\\n\\n' The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\\nCommittee or the Board of Governors.\\n\\n-2-\\n\\nproves this independence is warranted. We earn the right to operate with this independence\\nwhen we consistently follow the law and achieve our prudential objectives. One of the most\\neffective ways we accomplish this goal is through the appropriate prioritization of risks in the\\nfinancial system. Regardless of the approach to bank regulation and supervision, bank regulators\\nshould be subject to oversight and accountability, to both Congress and the public.\\n\\nThe principles that guide the execution of prudential responsibilities matter, especially\\nwhen they further efficiency and effectiveness. Congress has embedded the concept of tailoring\\nwithin the Federal Reserve's regulatory mandates, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory\\nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as S. 2155.? This law revised\\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, amending the threshold for tailored application of enhanced\\nprudential standards on certain regulated institutions.* Notably, S. 2155 did not introduce\\ntailoring to these standards; it merely modified tailoring thresholds and mandated the Board\\nimplement this approach. To be clear, tailoring is not a pretext for deregulation but rather a\\nprinciple that allows regulators to pursue required statutory objectives in the most efficient and\\neffective way.\\n\\nDoes Tailoring Need a Defender?\\n\\nI suppose one could view my support for tailoring as merely setting up a straw man;\\nsurely everyone agrees with tailoring in principle? On a superficial level, it is hard to argue with\\nthe principle that regulatory tailoring-matching regulation and supervision to risk-is a prudent\\napproach for bank regulators. And yet the rhetoric supporting tailoring and risk-based\\n\\nsupervision often does not match regulatory reform efforts or supervisory approaches. The\\n\\n?

Rather, they are implicit in the\\napproach to regulation and supervisory guidance or are disguised as a criticism of the execution\\nof tailoring.\\n\\nBoth the pending capital reform proposals and the final climate guidance illustrate how\\nregulatory actions can deviate from the principle of tailoring without any express recognition of\\nthis effect.\\n\\nThe federal banking agencies have proposed several reforms to the capital framework,\\namong them the Basel III \\\"endgame\\\" and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to\\nall banks with over $100 billion in assets. I have expressed concern with both of these proposals\\non the merits, in terms of striking the right balance between safety and soundness and efficiency\\nand fairness, and out of concern for potential unintended consequences. Another concern is\\nwhether these proposals show fidelity to the law, which requires regulatory tailoring above the\\n$100 billion asset threshold. In 2019, the Board published its regulatory tailoring rule and\\nincluded a compelling visual that depicts in table form how a series of requirements-capital,\\nsingle counterparty credit limits, liquidity, and the requirement to form a U.S. Intermediate\\nHolding Company for foreign banking organizations-worked collectively to establish a tiered\\n\\nframework.\\n\\n4 See Tailoring Rule Visual, \\\"Requirements for Domestic and Foreign Banking Organizations,\\\" October 10, 2019,\\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-20191010.pdf.\\n\\n\\nCapital\\n\\nSingle-counterparty credit\\nSCCL SCCL\\nsccr [SERENE + BHCMIHC level SCCL + BHCMHC level SCCL cory oe\\n\\u00ab FBOs: Meet home country I I \\u00a2 FBOs: Meet home country I I* melee OMe Loup CEES?

Of course, this simple exercise does not\\nreflect the unknown end state of the bank regulatory framework, and the current desire among\\nsome policymakers to modify liquidity requirements. These individual efforts highlight the\\nhazard of piecemeal reforms, especially those that are closely related in their end-state operation,\\nlike capital and long-term debt requirements. When regulators pursue reforms by creating\\nseparate rulemaking silos, we limit our capacity to not only ensure fidelity to tailoring but also\\nfidelity to our prudential mandates. Even when proposals have concurrent comment periods, the\\ndanger is that the final regulations will be miscalibrated and not appropriately tailored.\\n\\nTailoring underpins not only effective regulation, but also effective bank supervision.\\nThe effectiveness of the interagency principles used by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\\nInsurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the management of\\nclimate-related financial risks could be evaluated as a supervisory tool through the lens of\\ntailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the\\ncontent of the guidance.* One approach to evaluate the merit and effectiveness of these\\nprinciples as a supervisory tool is through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider\\nboth the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.\\n\\nOn its face, it applies to banks with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets. What\\ndoes this threshold mean in practice? Guidance serves the role of illuminating supervisory\\npriorities and expectations. These informal communications help bridge the divide between\\n\\nregulators and regulated entities.

Banks have long been exposed to\\nclimate- and weather-related financial risks and have long been required to manage all of their\\nmaterial risks, including these. But the principles seem oriented toward contributing to a policy\\nmatter that extends well beyond prudential bank regulation-namely how the U.S. and other\\ngovernments around the world should address climate change. And the principles seem focused\\non highly uncertain risks well outside the normal temporal horizon of a bank supervisor. One\\ncould reasonably ask, do the principles result in appropriate, risk-based prioritization of\\nsupervisory concerns? It is possible that they prioritize risks that may not be the most relevant\\nfor safety and soundness and may effectively influence credit allocation decisions through\\nregulations that are not driven primarily by prudential considerations.\\n\\nBank regulators can acknowledge the importance of questions around climate change\\nwhile also hewing to their statutory responsibilities. Promoting safety and soundness and U.S.\\n\\nfinancial stability is a weighty enough task without taking on other causes.\\n\\n\\u00a9 88 Fed.

For example, one\\nprominent argument raised shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and which has\\nbecome a driving force in regulatory reform efforts, is that the Board's approach to tailoring was\\nto blame for the bank failures and broader banking stress.* The argument is that a major factor\\ncontributing to the bank failures was the implementation of S. 2155, the statutory mandate to\\ntailor regulation and an accompanying shift in supervisory policy.\\n\\nAs I have noted many times in the past, I find little evidence to support this claim. While\\ncouched as a critique of the execution of tailoring, this argument also seems to challenge the\\nvalue of tailoring, asserting that a simple solution would be to unwind regulatory tailoring and\\neliminate risk-based tailoring in supervision. Taking ownership and accountability of the\\nsupervisory issues that significantly contributed to the banking system stress last spring enables\\nus to look critically at the approach to regulation and supervision in the lead-up to these failures,\\n\\nand appropriately address the shortcomings.\\n\\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \\\"Review of the Federal Reserve's Supervision and\\nRegulation of Silicon Valley Bank,\\\" (Washington: Board of Governors, April 2023), introductory letter by Michael\\nS. Barr, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf (concluding that \\\"[t]he Board's\\ntailoring approach in response to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act\\n(EGRRCPA) and a shift in the stance of supervisory policy impeded effective supervision by reducing standards,\\nincreasing complexity, and promoting a less assertive supervisory approach.\\\").\\n\\n\\nWhy Does Tailoring Matter?\\n\\nBefore thinking about tailoring for smaller, simpler firms, I think it's helpful to think\\nabout the largest, most complex firms. Additional regulation and heightened supervisory\\nattention are warranted and necessary for larger firms, particularly global systemically important\\nbanks (GSIBs) with additional size, risk, and complexity. This principle is so well-established\\nthat it was not only a core precept of S. 2155, it was a central theme of the Dodd-Frank Act.? We\\nneed not rely on past views about the virtue of tailoring-what was once conventional wisdom-\\nto believe in its ongoing relevance.\\n\\nOne critique of tailoring may be with what underlying \\\"problem\\\" it is designed to solve,\\nparticularly as it relates to the allocation of finite resources both for banks and for regulators.\\nAre regulatory and supervisory resources actually limited, and if so, what are the practical\\nconstraints on these resources? At a basic level, the quantum of regulatory and supervisory\\nresources is a policy decision-as regulatory and supervisory demands grow, so too can the\\nstaffs and budgets of the federal banking agencies. The U.S. financial system is expansive and\\nregulators have the capacity to expand supervisory resources as needed (or as perceived) to\\naddress safety and soundness concerns.\\n\\nOf course, there are practical constraints on an ever-expanding and stricter bank\\nregulatory framework. First, the funding of regulatory and supervisory expansion imposes costs\\nnot only on U.S. taxpayers but also on banks, and indirectly, bank customers. While the banking\\nsystem has many advantages- including the use of insured deposits as a source of financing\\nbanking activities-at some point, this structural advantage will erode under the cumulative\\n\\nburden of the regulatory framework and will result in a shift of activities from banks to nonbanks\\n\\n\\u00b0 Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1423, \\u00a7 165 (July 21, 2010).\\n\\n-9-\\n\\nand the broader shadow-banking system. The contours of the financial system, where products\\nand services are offered, does not exist according to the bright line of federal regulatory\\nauthority. We would be well served to recognize the limitations of a regulatory perimeter that\\npushes activity outside of the banking system and beyond this authority.\\n\\nUnintended Consequences\\n\\nAs we consider the merits of tailoring, we should consider the consequences of not\\nadhering to this principle in regulation and supervision, and related reform proposals.\\n\\nAs a threshold matter, a bank regulatory approach that disregards tailoring can manifest\\nin different ways, such as uniformity in approach-failing to differentiate among institutions\\nbased on their size, risk, and complexity-or by adopting regulatory \\\"cliffs\\\" clustered around\\nthresholds that insufficiently distinguish among institutions based on these factors. In both\\ncases, deviating from tailoring could result in fundamental changes to the structure of the U.S.\\nbanking system.\\n\\nOne risk of uniform requirements is the consolidation pressure it creates. Apart from the\\nshortcomings I've discussed in appropriate risk-based prioritization within the bank regulatory\\nframework, this approach encourages consolidation, as institutions seek operational economies\\nof scale to gain competitive advantage over their peers. In this scenario, the benefits of being\\nlarge, risky, and complex become a driving force in the organization of the banking industry. I\\nthink we should consider the implications not only for regulatory efficiency, but also whether\\nthis approach represents waving the white flag in fighting against the assertion that certain\\ninstitutions are \\\"too big to fail.\\\"\\n\\nEven where standards are not uniform, a lack of sufficient tailoring can reshape the\\n\\nbanking industry, simply through the cliff effects created around particular regulatory thresholds.\\n\\n-10-\\n\\nFor example, capital reform and climate regulation would establish $100 billion as the key\\nregulatory threshold, lending additional gravity to the decision to cross, or even approach it, with\\nthe consequence of reducing the number of institutions around that threshold. Institutions above\\nthe threshold will face strong incentives to grow larger to achieve economies of scale.\\nInstitutions be/ow the threshold will face strong incentives to manage their size to avoid the\\nsignificant intensification of requirements that apply as they approach $100 billion in assets.\\nThis scenario also has significant implications for the too-big-to-fail issue, as well as for industry\\ncompetition over the long term.\\n\\nRegulatory costs that are disproportionate to a firm's risk create incentives for activities\\nto migrate out of the banking system entirely, which we have seen as a consequence of past\\nregulatory reform efforts. In my view, implicit in the statutory mandate to promote safety and\\nsoundness, and financial stability, is that we allow banks to continue serving their role in the U.S.\\nfinancial system and in support of the economy. Fidelity to the law does not require regulators to\\ncreate a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk: banking is inherently about managing,\\nnot eliminating, risk.\\n\\nClosing\\nThank you, again, for the invitation to speak with you, and I look forward to our\\n\\ndiscussion.\\n\",\n          \"For release on delivery\\n10:30 a.m. EDT\\nMarch 25, 2024\\nThe Dual Mandate and the Balance of Risks\\nRemarks by\\nLisa D.

It seems today that standards may have slipped, but I am\\nnevertheless honored to be here.\\nI will start by saying what I said at the beginning of every course I taught here and\\nin my entire career as an academic economist. \\\"It is a great time to be an economist!\\\"\\nEconomics provides powerful tools for understanding the forces that affect your lives,\\nespecially in times of upheaval and change. This is another reason I am delighted to be\\npart of this course that covers a broad range of economic thinking.\\nthe Federal Reserve's\\nToday, I will focus my talk on three topics: dual mandate\\ngoals for monetary policy, recent indicators of progress toward meeting those goals, and\\nwhich means how the\\nwhat we call the evolving \\\"balance of risks,\\\" probabilities of\\nmissing one of those goals, compared to the other, change over time.1 My main message\\nis that, following a period of unusually high inflation and rapid monetary-policy\\ntightening, inflation has fallen considerably while the labor market has remained strong.\\nAs a result of these welcome developments, the risks to achieving our employment and\\ninflation goals are moving into better balance. Nonetheless, fully restoring price stability\\nmay take a cautious approach to easing monetary policy over time.\\nLet me add some background here. Congress has given the Federal Reserve's\\nmonetary policymakers a mandate and the independence with which to pursue it. The\\nFed's modern statutory mandate, as described in the 1977 amendment to the Federal\\n- 2 -\\nReserve Act, is to promote maximum employment and stable prices.2 These goals are\\ncommonly referred to as the dual mandate.3 I will elaborate on the benefits of achieving\\nthese objectives, starting with maximum employment.\\nBenefits of Maximum Employment\\nFederal Reserve's\\nI gave a speech last fall that described the evolution of the\\nemployment mandate.4 I discussed how leaders of the civil rights movement, including\\nCoretta Scott King, identified unemployment as a pernicious factor holding back\\ndisadvantaged communities and people. Mrs. King wisely noted that \\\"unemployment\\nlies at the root of all our major social problems.\\\"5 Economists also understand that high\\nunemployment has painful consequences for individual workers and their families. These\\ninclude reduced living standards and a greater incidence of poverty.\\nHigh levels of employment are key to a vibrant economy. It means that a vital\\nresource is being used most productively, resulting in a larger and more prosperous\\n2\\nBefore the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, maximum employment was already a legislated\\ngoal, applying to the whole of the federal government, through the Employment Act of 1946. One of the\\nEmployment Act's additional legislated goals, maximum purchasing power, had been interpreted as\\namounting to a price-stability goal.\\n3\\nThe 1977 amendment called on monetary policy \\\"to promote effectively the goals of maximum\\nemployment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\\\"; quoted text from the Federal Reserve\\nAct is in 12 U.S.C. \\u00a7 225a (2000), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm.

Low and stable inflation reduces\\nuncertainty about future prices and business conditions, promoting a favorable\\nenvironment for investment in productive capacity and human potential.\\nPrice stability means avoiding periods of high inflation, which are a particular\\nburden on those who are disadvantaged and least able to bear it. The costs of inflation\\nFed Listens\\nwere described by many community members in the events that the Federal\\nReserve has held in the past couple of years. Price stability also creates the conditions for\\na sustainably strong labor market. If inflation fluctuates a lot, it may require a more\\nforceful monetary policy response, and the process of reining in inflation can contribute\\nto bouts of higher unemployment. In contrast, price stability provides a background\\nagainst which employment can rise more steadily, which is why well-anchored inflation\\nexpectations are so important.\\nPrice Stability: Evolution and International Comparisons\\nWhile the Fed has considered price stability a key objective for its entire 110-year\\nhistory and the 1977 amendment made price stability an official goal in the Federal\\nReserve Act, a specific numerical objective for inflation is a relatively recent\\ndevelopment. The breakthrough came in January 2012, when the monetary policymakers\\nwho make up the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) stated that they judge that\\ninflation of 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price\\nindex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is most consistent with the Federal\\nReserve's mandate\\nof maximum employment and price stability.\\n- 5 -\\nThere were a few reasons to set an inflation of target of 2 percent, rather than\\nzero.9 Near-zero inflation can slide into sustained deflation, which is often associated\\nwith significant job losses, and debt burdens increase when prices are falling.\\nA positive inflation target also allows the central bank more room to adjust its\\nnominal policy rate to achieve a real interest rate sufficiently negative to provide stimulus\\nduring economic downturns.\\nAmong advanced economies (those with a high level of per capita GDP and\\nglobally integrated financial markets), all central banks have a mandate of price stability\\nwith a numerical objective. Most have 2 percent as either the target or the midpoint of a\\ntarget range.\\nMaximum Employment: Evolution and International Comparisons\\nAlthough other advanced-economy central banks do not have a dual mandate like\\nthe Fed, most of them explicitly or implicitly consider employment or economic activity\\nin their setting of monetary policy. Statutorily, employment is often a secondary mandate\\nto price stability. Functionally, these other central banks tend to describe the outlook for\\nemployment as affecting the speed with which they attempt to return inflation to their\\ntarget. For instance, if there is a shock that raises inflation above the target at a time\\nwhen the unemployment rate is also high, such a central bank would tighten policy less\\nthan if its only objective was to move inflation back to that target as quickly as possible.\\nThis way of operationalizing inflation targeting implies that there is a significant weight\\non employment in monetary policy decisions.\\n- 6 -\\nthe Fed's\\nIn the case of the United States, the difference is that Congress made\\nemployment mandate more explicit. Employment was always mentioned as an objective\\nof the Fed, but the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act made it part of the main\\nU.S. law applying to monetary policy.\\nThe Fed has not set a numerical target for its mandate of maximum employment.\\nThe unemployment rate is a key variable in evaluating progress toward that goal.\\nEconomists have a concept of the natural rate of unemployment, sometimes called u*,\\ndefined as the rate of unemployment compatible with a steady inflation rate. But u*\\ncannot be directly measured and is only imprecisely estimated. Moreover, it likely\\nchanges over time as the structure of the economy evolves.\\nThe aggregate unemployment rate is also not the only consideration in\\ndetermining whether we are meeting our maximum-employment goal. Labor force\\nparticipation also matters, as well as other elements of the labor market that I will discuss\\nlater.\\nMonetary Policy Tradeoffs\\nHow should we think about the tradeoff between our two goals? There is no\\nlong-run tradeoff that monetary policy can exploit. Monetary policy is generally thought\\nto be able to control inflation over the long run. In contrast, the maximum level of\\nemployment depends on structural forces and economic policies beyond the influence of\\nmonetary policy.\\nIn the short run, the two mandates often suggest the same course of action. This\\nis particularly true in the presence of demand shocks. For instance, a negative demand\\nshock in the economy will tend to raise unemployment and also put downward pressure\\n- 7 -\\non inflation. In this case, both mandates suggest a need for monetary stimulus to increase\\ndemand in the economy, bring down unemployment, and keep inflation from falling\\nsignificantly below target.\\nHowever, a negative supply shock (like a rise in oil prices) will tend to increase\\nboth inflation and unemployment at first, which creates a short-run tradeoff for monetary\\npolicy. Stimulus to bring down unemployment could push inflation even higher, but\\nresponding aggressively to inflation may have significant employment costs. The FOMC\\nlays out our approach to this potential tradeoff in its annual Statement on Longer-Run\\nGoals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which says the following:\\nThe Committee's\\nemployment and inflation objectives are generally\\ncomplementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges\\nthat the objectives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment\\nshortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over\\nwhich employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent\\nwith its mandate.10\\nIn 2022 and into 2023, with unemployment near historical lows but inflation at its\\nhighest level in four decades, it was clear that this approach to meeting the dual mandate\\nimplied forceful tightening of monetary policy. More recently, with inflation having\\nfallen substantially, even as the labor market has remained strong, it is worth considering\\nhow economic developments may have shifted policy tradeoffs and associated risks.\\nInflation Indicators\\nHow do we evaluate whether we are meeting our dual-mandate goals? Starting\\nwith inflation, we look at the 12-month change in the PCE price index, which rose to\\nmore than 7 percent in mid-2022 (slide 1). As economies around the world gradually\\n- 8 -\\nreopened after pandemic-related shutdowns, demand picked up, especially for goods.\\nBut supply chains were slower to recover, leading to a global surge in inflation. That\\nsurge was followed by a further upswing in inflation after February 2022, when Russia's\\ninvasion of Ukraine reduced global supplies of commodities, including oil and natural\\ngas, food, and fertilizers.\\nSince then, supply bottlenecks have eased, labor supply has recovered robustly,\\nand aggregate demand has been dampened by higher interest rates and the end of\\npandemic-era fiscal support. With supply and demand coming into better balance, PCE\\ninflation has retreated, reaching 2.4 percent in January.\\nBecause monetary policy affects the real economy, or the part of the economy that\\ninvolves producing goods and services, with a lag and affects inflation with an even\\nlonger lag, monetary policy must be forward-looking. Therefore, we look at measures\\nthat may provide better guides to the direction of future inflation. One such measure is\\ncore inflation (excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile). Core\\ninflation rose less sharply than overall inflation but has also moved down a bit less, to\\n2.8 percent in January.\\nTo understand how inflation has evolved in recent years, we can look at its\\ncomponents (slide 2). Food and energy prices helped drive the rise in inflation following\\nthe shocks from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation in these two\\nvolatile categories has slowed considerably since 2022 as supply constraints have eased,\\nalthough the level of grocery prices (in particular) remains elevated, which is a burden on\\nmany households.\\n- 9 -\\nAmong components of core inflation, core goods prices were most affected by\\nsupply bottlenecks and the shift toward more goods consumption during the pandemic.\\nCore goods inflation also has slowed most appreciably over the past two years, returning\\nrecently to its pre-pandemic trend of prices falling moderately. One salient example of\\nthe turnaround is in the motor vehicle sector. Shortages of computer chips used as\\ncomponents sharply curtailed automobile production, even as consumer demand for autos\\nrose amid reduced usage of public transportation. Those chip shortages drove vehicle\\nprices sharply higher, and their resolution and the subsequent rebound in auto production\\nhave driven a decline in vehicle prices over the past year.\\nPrices of core services excluding housing did not rise as dramatically as goods,\\nbut inflation in those services has also not come down as quickly. That partly reflected\\nstrong demand as households resumed their consumption of in-person services like travel\\nand dining. At the same time, because services prices tend to be adjusted less frequently\\nthan goods prices, it could also be that some prices are still adjusting to the increase in\\ninput costs during the pandemic.\\nHousing services prices were boosted by several factors. The surge in working\\nfrom home increased demand for larger homes and those located in less expensive metro\\nareas or further from city centers. Because these shifts in demand happened much more\\nrapidly than the response in housing supply, rents increased quite notably, especially for\\nsingle-family detached homes. Initially, new and existing homeowners were able to lock\\nin historically low long-term mortgage rates, which also drove up the demand for\\nhousing.\\nThe housing-services price index adjusts with a lag to changes in market rents (or\\nthe rent charged to a new tenant), because the index measures the rise in rents for all\\ntenants, including those with continuing leases whose rent is unchanged (slide 3). But\\neventually, as leases turn over, changes in the rental market are reflected in housing\\nservices prices. Although housing-services inflation remains quite high, the current low\\nrate of increase on new rental leases suggests that it will continue to fall.\\nThe public's expectations of future inflation affect spending decisions today and\\nin the near term, and, therefore, also influence current inflation. The Federal Reserve\\nlooks at a range of indicators of inflation expectations. Surveys of inflation expectations\\namong consumers and businesses can be informative, as are market-based measures such\\nas those from inflation-indexed Treasury securities (slide 4). These measures tell a\\nsimilar story. Shorter-run expectations rose through early 2022 amid uncertainty about\\nthe ultimate level and persistence of inflation. The sharp monetary policy tightening that\\nbegan in the spring of 2022 likely helped rein in those expectations, which have since\\nfallen to near pre-pandemic levels, and kept longer-run inflation expectations from rising\\nabove the range observed over the couple of decades before the pandemic.\\nLabor Market Indicators\\nAs I indicated earlier, an appropriate assessment of labor market conditions\\nrequires looking at a range of indicators. But, certainly, a key indicator in evaluating the\\nstrength of the labor market is the unemployment rate, which has remained near historical\\nlows even as the Fed has tightened policy and inflation has come down (slide 5).\\nLabor force participation also matters (slide 6). Good job opportunities can pull\\nmore people into the workforce. In the four years before the pandemic, a strong labor\\nmarket pulled in many workers aged 25 to 54, a group whose participation is less affected\\nby schooling and retirement. After falling sharply during the pandemic, participation in\\nthat age group has rebounded to its highest level in two decades. The rise was especially\\nsizable for women in this age range, whose participation rates recently reached all-time\\nhighs, perhaps boosted by the increased flexibility for those able to work from home.\\nIn contrast, participation among workers aged 55 or older has not recovered from\\nits decline during the pandemic. Older workers faced the greatest health risk from the\\npandemic. And their withdrawal from the labor market during the pandemic may have\\nled to a more permanent exit for this group, as they were already near or above typical\\nretirement ages. In addition, the surge in housing and stock prices substantially raised the\\nwealth levels of many in this age group, and this factor may have reduced some\\nhouseholds' reliance on\\nlabor income.\\nOne measure of the tightness or looseness of the labor market is available jobs\\nversus available workers (slide 7). The number of total available jobs (which includes\\nemployed workers and job openings) still exceeds the number of available workers in the\\nlabor force. This jobs-workers gap was around 2.4 million in February, down\\nsignificantly from its peak of 6 million in March 2022 but still above its 2019 average of\\n1.1 million. Part of the narrowing in this gap may have come from immigration. The\\nrebound in immigration from the lows recorded during the pandemic has boosted growth\\nin the working-age population.\\nChurn, or an elevated level of turnover, in the labor market was prevalent during\\nthe initial recovery from the pandemic-related downturn. Workers saw opportunities to\\nget a better job or higher pay elsewhere, driving up the share who voluntarily quit their\\njobs (slide 8).\\nSigns that the labor market is normalizing have emerged more recently. Quits,\\nwhich were very elevated in 2021 and 2022, have fallen below pre-pandemic levels. And\\nthe wage growth differential between job switchers and those staying in their jobs has\\nnarrowed.11\\nComprehensive measures of wage growth also show gradual cooling. Notably,\\nthe employment cost index for the private sector rose 4.1 percent on a 12-month basis in\\nDecember, down from 5.1 percent over the previous 12 months but still well above the\\npace in the years before the pandemic (slide 9).\\nTo some extent, this elevated wage growth is catching up to the previous surge in\\ninflation. Whether wage growth at these levels is associated with upward pressure on\\ninflation depends importantly on trends in labor productivity and on whether firms allow\\ntheir profit margins to fall. If productivity growth is strong, that is, if more output can be\\nproduced with fewer inputs, a faster pace of wage growth need not be inflationary.\\nMeasured productivity is usually volatile and has been especially so since the\\npandemic (slide 10). Nonetheless, an important part of the strong supply response last\\nyear was labor productivity growth, which was a robust 2.6 percent. The recent surge in\\nmeasured productivity may reflect a few factors. One is that labor market churn during\\nthe earlier stages of this expansion may have moved workers to higher-paying, more\\nproductive jobs.12 Another possible factor is that the rise in new businesses since the\\npandemic may increase innovation over time.13\\nLooking ahead, I see artificial intelligence (AI) as a potentially significant source\\nof productivity growth. If for no other reason, it could greatly increase the speed with\\nwhich ideas are disseminated into the economy. But that will take time. Although\\nadoption of generative AI is happening at a rapid clip, we know from economic history\\nthat the full benefit of a new technology requires complementary investment as well as\\nchanges in corporate structure, management practices, and worker training.\\nThe Balance of Risks for Monetary Policy\\nTaking all these inflation and labor market indicators together, and as noted in the\\nmost recent FOMC statement, the risks to achieving our inflation and employment goals\\nare moving into better balance. The risk of easing monetary policy too much or too soon\\nis that it could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and halt the progress\\nthat we have seen. That would ultimately require more-restrictive monetary policy to\\nwring more-persistent inflation out of the economy, at a potentially high cost to\\nemployment. But easing too late could also do unnecessary harm by holding back the\\neconomy and depriving people of economic opportunities. The path of disinflation, as\\nexpected, has been bumpy and uneven, but a careful approach to further policy\\n12\\nSee David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2023), \\\"The Unexpected Compression:\\nCompetition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market,\\\" NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge,\\nMass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March; revised November 2023),\\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31010/w31010.pdf.\\n13\\nSee Ryan A.
