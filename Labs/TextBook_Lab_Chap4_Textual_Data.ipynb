This gathering comes a few weeks after the announcement\\nof this year's stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the highlights of those results.\\nThey show that our financial system remains resilient and that capital planning by banks\\ncontinues to improve. The largest and most complex banks were tested against a severe\\nhypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well above their minimum\\nrequirements. They demonstrated the ability to withstand a severe and lasting economic\\ndownturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses. Additionally, most firms are\\nnow meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure capital planning takes into account\\ntheir specific risks and vulnerabilities. This is an improvement from last year. Overall, these\\nresults are good news that confirm our financial system is significantly stronger than before the\\ncrisis.\\nNow let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our understanding of the\\nexperience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to think about the future. And let\\nme begin by acknowledging that-notwithstanding our openness to learning from the collective\\nexperience of all of us in this room-the future of stress testing will, in a number of important\\nways, necessarily resemble the past. For example, we're still going to have them. Over the\\ncourse of the last 18 months, I have heard overwhelmingly-from academics, from think tanks of\\nevery stripe, from banks of every size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreign-\\nthat stress tests should continue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve's supervision of\\nsystemically important banks and a key aspect of the Fed's efforts to promote financial stability.\\nStress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic. And the banks' performance on these\\ntests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the affected\\nbanks' capital requirements.\\nTransparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental principle of the\\nfirst stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a primary goal. Stress tests,\\nas ever, will provide the public with essential information to assess the health of banks and the\\noverall financial system. To be credible, stress tests will also continue to provide significant\\ninformation about how the Fed does its work, so the public can understand the rigor and\\nindependence of our assessment process and how we come to our judgment of the firms we\\ntest.\\nFidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress test a decade\\nago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn't changed over the\\nyears. We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and added useful features and\\nadjustments. These include a counterparty default scenario, as well as a number of policy\\nstatements that more explicitly convey the principles we find important in a sensible stress\\ntesting program.\\nStress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as supervisors learn\\nfrom our work and what we can learn from others. Each year, we have refined both the\\nsubstance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own experience and by critiques\\nand suggestions from others. This feedback comes from a variety sources, including\\nconferences such as this one, and I am confident that the presentations today will provide\\ninsights that result in improvements in our stress tests.\\nIf stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that they must\\ncontinue to change: they must respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and the\\nrisk-management capabilities of firms. Evolutionary change has been a consistent principle of\\nstress testing since the beginning, embraced by my predecessors at the Board of Governors\\nand our supervisory staff and reflected in each cycle of tests. Without such adjustments,\\nregulators, banks, and the broader public cannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital\\npositions of the largest banks.\\nStress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around the capital\\nadequacy of our largest banks. Stress tests results should allow investors, counterparties,\\nanalysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the condition of banks. Along with\\nother regulatory measures, this transparency increases market discipline and it subjects the\\nFederal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and analysis. Accountability is important not only for\\nthe usual reasons that apply in a democracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only\\nbe effective when the public has confidence in the Fed's evaluation of the capital adequacy of\\nbanks. In effect, stress tests are also a test of the Fed's supervision of large banks.\\nIn these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk management, the\\neconomy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to stress tests over the past\\ndecade. Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which is a founding principle for\\nstress tests. I will then suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of stress testing can be\\nfurther enhanced with greater transparency.\\nTen years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the first stress\\ntest results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP). At that moment, the\\nU.S. economy was in free fall. The United States had lost an astonishing three million jobs in the\\nprevious four months. One significant reason for these losses was that many businesses were\\nseverely constrained in their access to funding and found it impossible to predict when that\\naccess might improve. The goal of the first test was urgent and simple: to restore confidence in\\nthe 19 large banks that then accounted for two-thirds of the assets in the banking system. In fact,\\nsimply announcing in March that there would be tests helped stabilize bank finances. That\\nimprovement continued after the results in May outlined the quite feasible steps for raising\\nadditional capital that the banks would need to take, and did take, to be able to continue lending if\\nadverse conditions continued. Challenging conditions did continue, but the stress tests and other\\nactions taken in the first half of 2009 marked a turning point. The recovery from the Great\\nRecession began in July, as the financial system came back to life, and then steadily\\nstrengthened.\\nThe principles that made that first test so effective were independence and transparency. For the\\nfirst time, an independent authority, the Federal Reserve, would seek to independently assess\\n1\\nrisks. Just as important, the details of that assessment would be shared with the public, an\\nextent of transparency that until then wasn't characteristic of bank supervision but would become\\nthe hallmark of the regulatory framework erected in response to the crisis. The first tests relied\\nheavily on banks' internal risk models, but they still represented a huge step in independence in\\nproviding the public with an assessment of the health and resiliency of large banks.\\nTransparency facilitated both market discipline and accountability. The information provided to\\nthe public under the SCAP stress test reinforced the entire enterprise of estimating the capital\\nshortfall faced by major banks. It held the banks accountable for information on their capital\\nadequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.\\nThe next big step for stress testing came with its integration with the Federal Reserve's\\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning in 2011. One big change from\\nthe initial SCAP test was that stress tests were no longer a one-time emergency measure\\nintended to restore confidence in major financial institutions. Instead, they became a recurring,\\nongoing process intended to maintain confidence in major institutions. Second, stress tests were\\nno longer a discretionary exercise by supervisors-under Dodd-Frank, they became the law of\\nthe land. And third, when they were integrated into CCAR, stress tests became part of a\\ncomprehensive-it's the first C in CCAR-framework for capital planning that more closely\\nconnected capital regulation to risk management of banks and overall supervision.\\nThese were changes, but with the effect of reinforcing the founding principles of the SCAP test.\\nTransparency was enhanced when stress tests became mandatory, recurring events and the\\npublic could depend on continuing to have access to information about banks' capital adequacy.\\nAlso, the independence of those judgments was enhanced when Congress made them a\\nstatutory responsibility for the Fed and when they were integrated into our CCAR framework.\\nFurther changes to stress testing have likewise reinforced the original goals. Stress testing\\nscenarios have become richer and more challenging, providing more information about how\\nbanks would deal with a range of adverse developments and, for example, exploring the effects\\nof more differentiated risks that are not tied to the business cycle. Large trading banks now face\\nan instantaneous shock to their trading assets, and many participants in the stress tests now\\nmust address how they would respond to the failure of their largest counterparty.\\nOur stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand a severe\\nrecession. The capital-building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete, but as part of\\nCCAR, stress testing continues to contribute to the significant and ongoing improvement since\\n2009 in risk management by banks. The original reason for the qualitative objection aspect of\\nstress testing was to provide incentives for banks to address the risk-management\\nshortcomings that the Federal Reserve had observed during the financial crisis. For example,\\nmany firms supervised by the Federal Reserve had substantial deficiencies in their ability to\\nmeasure, monitor, and manage their risks. These shortcomings made it difficult for banks to\\naccurately report their risk exposures to the Board, and consequently, threatened to undermine\\nthe credibility of the stress tests, which were, and remain, dependent on data from the banks.\\nSince the beginning of CCAR in 2011, large banks have significantly improved their\\nriskmanagement and capital-planning processes. The qualitative assessment conducted as part of\\nthe 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles found that most firms either meet or are very close to meeting\\nthe Federal Reserve's supervisory expectations for capital planning. Large banks have improved\\nthe methods they use to identify their unique risks, now use sound practices for identifying and\\naddressing model weaknesses, and have strong processes in place to evaluate their capital\\npositions on a forward-looking basis. While we continue to perform a qualitative assessment and\\nensure that progress is retained, the improvements led the Federal Reserve to conclude that for\\nmost banks this assessment can be incorporated into our regular supervisory practices. The\\nevolution of our qualitative assessment reflects the experience of the past 10 years of stress\\ntesting, and in particular, the great improvement in risk management by large banks and the\\ncumulative effect of the Fed's improved supervision of large institutions. As I said earlier, for\\nstress testing to remain effective, it must respond to changes in the economy, the financial\\nsystem, and risk-management capabilities.\\nThe changes to CCAR have occurred in the context of a similarly dramatic improvement in the\\nstrength and resilience of the financial system. The firms have more than doubled their capital\\nsince the first round of stress tests in 2009. Since that time, the common equity of the largest 18\\nfirms has increased by more than $650 billion.\\nLet me now turn to the most recent changes to CCAR and stress testing and put them in the\\ncontext of the history I have just related. Congress revisited large bank supervision last year in S.\\n2155, yet the legislation it passed reaffirmed the important role of stress testing. This shouldn't\\nbe surprising, because the experience of stress testing over the last 10 years has demonstrated\\nthat it is a highly useful element of large bank supervision and the promotion of financial stability.\\nSomething else that shouldn't be surprising is that this experience has revealed that periodic\\nstress testing has turned out to be a less useful supervisory tool to evaluate the risks of smaller\\nand less complex financial institutions. Congress made use of this experience by raising the\\nthreshold for stress testing to $100 billion in assets and providing more flexibility for the Fed to\\ntailor stress testing for all firms. This step has, once again, advanced the principles\\ndemonstrated in the first stress test and ever since. It has increased transparency because\\nincorporating and disclosing what we have learned about the varying effectiveness of stress\\ntesting at different types of institutions is making stress testing more effective. The accountability\\nof the Fed is enhanced when we are seen taking on board what we have learned through\\nsuccessive cycles of stress tests, and this strengthens the independence and credibility of our\\njudgments. For those of us who believe stress testing should remain central to supervision and\\npromoting financial stability, it is vital that an adjustment such as this takes place as appropriate.\\nWith that in mind, let me review recent changes and proposed changes to the Federal Reserve's\\nstress testing. These changes are designed to make CCAR more transparent and simple and to\\nfeature less unnecessary volatility.\\nThe first principle is transparency. We have taken a number of recent steps to enhance the\\ntransparency around our models and the stress testing process more generally. Earlier this year,\\nthe Board published enhanced disclosures on two of the key models that we use in stress\\ntesting. In addition, the Board published estimated loss rates for groups of loans with distinct\\ncharacteristics, to show how supervisory models treat specific assets under stress. We will\\npublish disclosures about two additional models in 2020 and each year thereafter until we have\\nprovided transparency about all our stress test models. At the same time, we published a new\\npolicy statement on our approach to supervisory stress testing. Among other things, the\\nstatement emphasizes the importance of independence and stability to the credibility of our\\nstress tests.\\nWe are currently considering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and\\nscenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and\\npossible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and salient risks facing the\\nbanking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the\\nscenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios, and a range of other\\nenhancements.\\nSome argue that the greater transparency and disclosure promoted by recent changes and\\n2\\nproposed changes to stress testing amounts to providing banks with the answers to the tests.\\nThis both overstates the extent of disclosure involved and misunderstands what we are trying to\\naccomplish in stress testing-goals that haven't changed since the spring of 2009.\\nIf the goal were only to conduct a test that was difficult to pass-like the qualifying exams for\\nsome of the more esoteric and restrictive high-IQ societies-then trying to explain principles,\\nscenario design, and how models work would be inappropriate. If the measure of success for the\\nFed in administering a stress test was simply how many banks failed, then greater transparency\\nwould indeed be a mistake. But that is not the purpose of stress testing, and it never has been.\\nThe vitally important goal is to improve and sustain good risk management and capital planning\\nat the individual institutions we supervise and to promote the stability of the financial system. Like\\na teacher, we don't want banks to fail, we want them to learn. In this case, we want them to learn\\ngood risk management in the context of forward-looking capital planning. This will provide the\\npublic with more information about the capital planning of major banks, and about how the\\nFederal Reserve views good capital planning and risk management, bolstering our credibility.\\nThe second principle reflected in recent changes to stress testing is simplicity. One important\\nproposal-what we are calling the stress capital buffer-would simplify the Fed's large bank\\ncapital rule by integrating the stress testing process with our traditional regulatory capital rules.\\nOur regulatory capital rule includes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on\\ntop of those minimum requirements. The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to\\nsupervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the\\nminimum requirements. Integrating these two standards is a natural evolution of CCAR away\\nfrom its origins during the crisis, when such tailoring was impractical and policy makers had not\\nyet considered the approach of a regulatory capital buffer on top of a regulatory capital minimum.\\nThe stress capital buffer would result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory\\ncapital requirements because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.\\nThe stress capital buffer would not reduce the stringency of the regulatory capital framework for\\nlarge banks, but it would effect a substantial simplification of that framework. By my math, the\\nnumber of different capital requirements applicable to large banks would fall from 18 to eight and\\nthe number of different total loss absorbing capacity requirements for large banks would fall from\\n24 to 14. I expect that we will move forward with a revised stress capital buffer proposal in the\\nnear future, reflecting many of the comments received on our original proposal.\\nThe third principle addressed by the recent changes is volatility. When I think about volatility in\\nstress testing, I want to distinguish what I consider to be useful variation in the tests, in the form\\nof exploration of salient risks, from what I consider to be less useful variation, in the form of\\nunexpected swings in capital requirements that don't have any particular relationship to changing\\nrisks at individual firms. In addition, one source of volatility in the tests comes from the fact that\\nbanks are forced to do their capital planning before they get the results of our tests. I will address\\neach of these concerns in turn.\\nIn distinguishing useful from less useful volatility, one option to address the year-over-year\\nvolatility of the tests would be to average the results of the tests from the previous year or years.\\nThis would not affect the overall stringency of the tests but, mathematically, would mean that no\\nsingle year could have an outsized influence on the amount of capital that a bank is required to\\nmaintain. The potential downsides to this approach include the reduced risk sensitivity that a\\nbank may experience to a particular test and potential technical challenges associated with\\nchanges to a bank's balance sheet and earnings. Bearing in mind these potential challenges, I\\nbelieve more thinking and discussion of this issue would be fruitful.\\nWith respect to the second concern, as I have said before, I believe it more rational and logical\\nfor firms to be able to plan for their capital needs with the benefit of the results of our tests. Given\\nthe huge strides that the banks have made in their capital planning and in meeting our\\nexpectations, I view the risk of banks backsliding in this regard to be minimal because it would be\\nevident in the next test. Our capital-planning expectations will not decline, and we will continue to\\nuse the supervisory process to enforce these expectations. It is my hope that greater\\ntransparency can play a role in other parts of our supervisory process-for example, by allowing\\nother aspects of bank supervision to benefit from public input. Greater transparency for\\nsupervision is in keeping with one of the biggest improvements to the regulatory framework and\\nto stress testing since the financial crisis. I believe the changes and proposed changes to stress\\ntesting that I have discussed today reinforce the founding principles of the first test, administered\\nin the challenging and uncertain spring of 2009, and reflect what we have learned each year over\\nthe decade since then. That process of learning and refining should and must continue in order\\nto keep stress tests as relevant and effective as they have been in helping to reduce the chances\\nof another severe crisis.\\nbanking firms' assets,\\\" Journal of Financial Economics 71, no.3 (2004): 419-60.\",\n          \"Daniel K Tarullo: Regulating large foreign banking organizations\\nSpeech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\\nSystem, at the Harvard Law School Symposium on \\\"Building the Financial System of the\\nTwenty-first Century: An Agenda for Europe and the United States\\\", Armonk, New York,\\n27 March 2014.\\n* * *\\nThe financial crisis exposed, in painful and dramatic fashion, the shortcomings of existing\\nregulatory and supervisory regimes. In both the United States and the European Union (EU),\\nthe crisis also revealed some particular vulnerabilities created by foreign banking operations.\\nThis evening I would like to focus on these vulnerabilities and on how best we should\\naddress them.\\nLet me note at the outset the now commonplace observation that we have a quite integrated\\ninternational financial system, with many large, globally active firms operating within a\\nsystem of national government and regulation or, in the case of the EU, a hybrid of regional\\nand national regulation. I add the equally commonplace observation that there is no realistic\\nprospect for having a global banking regulator and, consequently, the responsibility and\\nauthority for financial stability will continue to rest with national or regional authorities.1 The\\nquestion, then, is how responsibility for oversight of these large firms can be most effectively\\nshared among regulators. This, of course, is the important issue underlying the perennial\\nchallenge of home-host supervisory relations.\\nAnother introductory observation is that - at least in a world of nations with substantially\\ndifferent economic circumstances, different currencies, and banking and capital markets of\\nquite different levels of depth and development - there will be good reason to vary at least\\nsome forms of regulation across countries. Presumptively, at least, nations should be able to\\nadjust their regulatory systems based on local circumstances and their relative level of risk\\naversion as it pertains to the potential for financial instability. Although the financial systems\\nand economies of the United States and the EU are more similar to one another than they\\nare to those of many other jurisdictions, they are hardly identical. Even between these two,\\nfor example, there may be legitimate differences within the broader convergence around\\nminimum regulatory and supervisory standards developed at the Basel Committee, the\\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions, the Financial Stability Board, and\\nother forums.\\nThese opening observations are important in responding to the curious charge of\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" that has been levelled at the United States and, to a lesser extent, some\\nother jurisdictions, as a result of actions taken or proposed in response to problems\\npresented by foreign banks during the crisis. I say \\\"curious\\\" for several reasons. One is that\\nthe charge reflects a misunderstanding of the allocation of responsibility between home and\\nhost supervisors that has evolved in the Basel Committee during the past several decades.\\nAnother is that the charge seems implicitly, and oddly, premised on the notion that what we\\nhad in 2007 was a well-functioning, integrated global financial system with effective\\nconsolidated supervision of global banks. A third is that the charge overlooks the fact that\\nmuch of what the United States is now doing is matching what the EU has quite sensibly\\nbeen doing for years.\\nIn the rest of my remarks I will elaborate on these points, though not in the spirit of a\\ndebater's arguments, but in an effort to answer the question I posed a moment ago: How,\\nthat is, can we successfully reduce the risks to financial stability posed by large,\\ninternationally active banks? As I hope will become apparent, a theme I wish to emphasize is\\nthat we need to redouble efforts at genuine supervisory cooperation if we are to manage\\neffectively the vulnerabilities and challenges posed by the perennial home-host issue.\\nInternational principles on home- and host-country responsibilities\\nWhile the circumstances and risks may have changed, the issue of the appropriate roles of\\nhome and host countries is not a new one. Indeed, it was a key motivation for creation of the\\nBasel Committee in 1975 following the failures of the Herstatt and Franklin National banks.\\nMany of the Basel Committee's early activities were focused on the challenges created by\\ngaps in the supervision of internationally active banks, as evidenced by the fact that Basel\\n\\\"Concordats\\\" on supervision preceded Basel \\\"Accords\\\" and \\\"Frameworks\\\" on capital and\\nother subjects. This task has, of necessity, been ongoing, as experience revealed gaps in\\nsupervisory coverage and as the scale and scope of internationally active banks grew. The\\nprinciple of consolidated supervision emerged in the early 1980s to ensure that some specific\\nbanking authority - generally the home-country regulator - had a complete view of the\\nassets and liabilities of the bank.2 This principle was reinforced and elaborated following the\\nBank of Credit and Commerce International episode in the early 1990s.3\\nIt is important to note that each Basel Committee declaration on the importance of\\nhomecountry consolidated oversight has also included a statement of the obligations and\\nprerogatives of host states in which significant foreign bank operations are located. This\\nfeature of the Basel Committee's approach makes sense as a reflection both of the host\\nauthority's responsibility for stability of its financial system and of the practical point that a\\nhost authority will be more familiar with the characteristics and risks in its market. In\\naccordance with this history, the current version of the \\\"Core Principles for Effective Banking\\nSupervision\\\" sets out as one of its \\\"essential criteria\\\" for home-host relationships that \\\"[t]he\\nhost supervisor's national laws or regulations require that the cross-border operations of\\nforeign banks are subject to prudential, inspection and regulatory reporting requirements\\nsimilar to those for domestic banks.\\\"4\\nIt is clear, then, that consolidated supervision is not intended to displace host-country\\nsupervision. Instead, as the Basel Committee has regularly noted, the two are intended to be\\ncomplementary, so as to assure effective oversight of large, internationally active banks.\\nSimilarly, the stated purpose of the Basel Committee in requiring consolidated capital\\nrequirements is not to remove from host countries any responsibility or discretion to apply\\nregulatory capital requirements, but to \\\"preserve the integrity of capital in banks with\\nsubsidiaries by eliminating double gearing.\\\"5 Likewise, and contrary to suggestions that are\\nsometimes made, the capital accords and frameworks developed by the Basel Committee\\nhave always been explicitly minimum requirements. They are floors, not ceilings.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in establishing a post-crisis framework for domestic\\nsystemically important banks (D-SIBs), the Basel Committee made clear that a host country\\nmay in appropriate circumstances designate domestic operations of a foreign bank as\\nsystemically important for that country, even if the parent foreign bank has already been\\ndesignated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).6 The idea informing the newly\\ncreated concept of a D-SIB is that an entity whose stress or failure could destabilize a\\ndomestic financial system might thereby indirectly destabilize the international financial\\nsystem. Thus, the D-SIB category carries along with it higher loss-absorbency requirements\\nthan are generally applicable to domestic banks, although perhaps not as high as\\nrequirements for G-SIBs. Of course, our regulation for foreign banking organizations (FBOs)\\ndoes not entail D-SIB designation or require higher than generally applicable loss\\nabsorbency. But I cite this feature of the D-SIB framework that permits designation of the\\ndomestic operations of foreign G-SIBs because it reflects rather clearly the principle that the\\nspecific characteristics of domestic markets may call for regulation of foreign banks in the\\nhost country, not just at a consolidated level.\\nIn short, the work of the Basel Committee over the years has not been directed at restraining\\nhost-country authorities from supervising and regulating foreign banking operations in their\\ncountry. On the contrary, the committee has repeatedly asserted the complementary\\nresponsibilities of both home and host countries to oversee large, internationally active\\nbanking groups, in the interests of both national and international financial stability. And the\\ncommittee has frequently returned to this set of issues in responding to developments that\\npose a threat to the safety and soundness of the international financial system.\\nThe shift in foreign bank activities\\nUnfortunately, neither the Basel Committee nor national regulators responded in a timely\\nfashion to the magnitude of the expansion in scale and scope of the world's largest banking\\norganizations in the roughly 15 years before the financial crisis. As illustrated in figure 1, at\\nthe end of 1974, just before the Basel Committee was created, the assets of the world's\\n10 largest banking organizations together equaled about 8 percent of global GDP. The three\\nlargest were all American - BankAmerica, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan. But their\\ncombined assets were equal to less than 3-1/2 percent of world GDP and, as illustrated in\\nfigure 2, about 10 percent of the GDP of their home country, the United States. By 1988 the\\ncombined assets of the world's 10 largest banking organizations as a proportion of world\\nGDP had nearly doubled to about 15 percent, a ratio that held constant during the\\nsucceeding decade, at the beginning of the emerging market financial crisis in 1997.\\nThen the explosive growth began. In the next decade - that is, up to the onset of the financial\\ncrisis in 2007 - the combined assets of the world's 10 largest banks as a share of global\\nGDP nearly tripled, to about 43 percent. The largest bank in the world at that time, Royal\\nBank of Scotland (RBS), had assets equivalent to about 6.8 percent of global GDP, nearly\\ntwice the comparable figure for the three largest banks combined in 1974. Adding the assets\\nof Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas - the second and third largest banks in 2007 - to those\\nof RBS, the three had combined assets equal to about 17 percent of global GDP. And each\\nof the three had assets nearly equal to, or in one instance substantially more than, the GDP\\nof its home country. Even the eighth-ranked bank, UBS, had assets well over four times the\\nGDP of its home country, Switzerland.\\nNot only did the size of the largest banks change dramatically, so, too, did their scope,\\nreflecting the overall integration of capital market and traditional lending activities that\\naccelerated in the decade and a half preceding the crisis. This trend was particularly\\napparent in the United States and the United Kingdom, homes to the world's two largest\\nfinancial centers. In the United States, the proportion of foreign banking assets to total U.S.\\nbanking assets has remained constant at approximately one-fifth since the late 1990s. But\\nthe concentration and character of those assets have changed noticeably. Today there are\\nas many foreign as U.S.-owned banks with at least $50 billion in U.S. assets, the threshold\\nestablished by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for banks\\nfor which more stringent prudential measures must be established.7 Perhaps even more\\nimportant was the shift in composition of foreign bank assets in the 15 years before the crisis,\\nwith the proportion of assets held in the U.S. broker-dealers of the 10 largest FBOs rising\\nfrom approximately 15 percent to roughly 50 percent.8 Today, 4 of the top 10 broker-dealers\\nin the United States, and 12 of the top 20, are owned by foreign banks.\\nMeanwhile, even the traditional branching model of large foreign commercial banks in the\\nUnited States had changed. Reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased\\nsignificantly. Many foreign banks shifted from the \\\"lending branch\\\" model to a \\\"funding\\nbranch\\\" model, in which U.S. branches of foreign banks were borrowing large amounts of\\nU.S. dollars to upstream to their parents. These \\\"funding branches\\\" went from holding\\n40 percent of foreign bank branch assets in the mid-1990s to holding 75 percent of foreign\\nbank branch assets by 2009. Foreign banks as a group moved from a position of receiving\\nfunding from their parents on a net basis in 1999 to providing significant funding to non-U.S.\\naffiliates by the mid-2000s - more than $600 billion on a net basis by 2008.9\\nA good bit of this short-term funding was used to finance long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated\\nproject and trade finance around the world. There is also evidence that a significant portion\\nof the dollars raised by European banks in the pre-crisis period ultimately returned to the\\nUnited States in the form of investments in U.S. securities. Indeed, the amount of U.S.\\ndollardenominated asset-backed securities and other securities held by Europeans increased\\nsignificantly between 2003 and 2007, much of it financed by the short-term,\\ndollardenominated liabilities of European banks.10\\nJust as regulatory systems did not, in the years preceding the crisis, address vulnerabilities\\nsuch as reliance on short-term wholesale funding that were created by the integration of\\ncapital markets and traditional lending, so they did not respond to the transformation of\\nforeign banking operations. Accordingly, just as home countries of systemically important\\nbanks have been playing catch-up on capital, liquidity, and other requirements, so host\\ncountries of very large foreign banking operations are playing catch-up in dealing with the\\nvery different character of many internationally active banks from that of 20 or 30 years ago.\\nThe regulatory response\\nIn a sense, the major strengthening during the past few years of capital and liquidity\\nrequirements for internationally active banks - including the capital surcharge for banks of\\nglobal systemic importance - has to date been the most important international regulatory\\nresponse to the revealed vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations.\\nBuilding capital and improving the liquidity positions of banks on a consolidated basis is\\nsurely a key step toward assuring the stability of major FBOs in host countries.\\nOf course, these agreed changes have not yet been fully implemented. It is critical not just\\nthat all jurisdictions adopt appropriate regulations that fully incorporate the new Basel\\nstandards, but also that we ensure our banks will be substantively, and not just formally,\\ncompliant as the various transition target dates are reached. It is also the case that there is\\nmore to be done in addressing the risks posed by large global banking organizations,\\nincluding additional measures to deal with the run risks associated with short-term wholesale\\nfunding and ensuring that even the largest firms can be successfully resolved without either\\ncreating major systemic problems or requiring an infusion of public capital. I will return to\\nthese subjects a bit later, in discussing the cooperative agenda that lies ahead for the United\\nStates, Europe, and our partners throughout the world.\\nFirst, though, I want to describe how Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States are\\ndealing with the vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations, and thus are\\nfulfilling their responsibilities as host-country supervisors. I discuss the United Kingdom\\nseparately from the EU both because it is outside the euro zone and because, as a host\\njurisdiction, it is more similar to the United States than to other EU member states or, indeed,\\nto any other country in the world.\\nThe EU has not, since the crisis, specifically adjusted the structure of regulation of foreign\\nbanks by its member states in their role as host supervisors. For more than a decade before\\nthe crisis, EU member states had prudently required that not only commercial banking, but\\nalso investment banking subsidiaries of foreign (non-EU-based) banking organizations, be\\nsubject to Basel capital requirements in the same way as EU-based firms. With the adoption\\nof CRD IV,11 the directive implementing the new EU capital requirements, Basel III will now\\nbe applied to all EU firms, including EU bank and investment bank subsidiaries of non-EU\\nbanking organizations. Branches of non-EU banks are generally not subject to local\\nrequirements.\\nBefore the crisis and the subsequent development of Basel III, there was no leverage ratio\\nrequirement in EU capital directives. Insofar as a new leverage ratio is part of the Basel III\\npackage agreed upon internationally, one would anticipate that it will be applied to\\ncommercial banking and investment banking firms in the EU, again including local\\nsubsidiaries of non-EU firms. Likewise, one would anticipate that the Basel III liquidity\\nrequirements will be implemented in the EU in accordance with the internationally agreed\\ntimeline and, again, that it will apply to EU subsidiaries of FBOs.\\nA greater challenge for the EU has been dealing with banks headquartered in one EU\\ncountry but doing business in other EU countries under the \\\"single passport,\\\" which basically\\nallows for full access in the rest of the EU, with supervision provided only by the home\\ncountry. During the crisis, there were some notable instances of banking stresses and\\nfailures involving such institutions, with consequent negative effects on depositors,\\ncounterparties, and economies in other parts of the EU. Much of the ongoing post-crisis\\nreform agenda in Europe seems directed at ensuring the safety and soundness of EU-based\\ninstitutions. The most important of these changes may be the assumption by the European\\nCentral Bank of supervisory responsibility for larger euro area banks. And, as we saw just\\nlast week, work continues on the long process of creating a credible resolution mechanism\\nfor those banks.\\nAs a member state of the EU, the United Kingdom of course implements the EU policies I\\nhave just described. But that country has applied an additional set of requirements on the\\nlocal operations of foreign banks, particularly with respect to liquidity. The Prudential\\nRegulation Authority of the Bank of England applies local liquidity requirements to\\ncommercial and investment banking subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks, requiring them to hold\\nlocal buffers as determined by internal stress tests with both 14- and 90-day components.\\nThe assumptions on which the stress tests are premised are quite strict. For example, the\\nU.K. subsidiary generally must assume zero inflows from non-U.K. affiliates - even for claims\\non non-U.K. affiliates with short terms that mature within the stress test period - and\\n100 percent outflows to non-U.K. affiliates. The requirements generated by the test are\\nsubject to a supervisory review and add-on that for some firms has resulted in a significant\\nincrease in the buffer requirement. Branches of foreign commercial banks may in some\\ncircumstances be subject to local liquidity requirements as well.\\nThe U.K. initiative in applying local liquidity requirements is wholly understandable in light of\\nthe difficulties encountered because of stress on foreign institutions, including the Lehman\\nbankruptcy, during the crisis. Because London is one of the world's two largest financial\\ncenter hosts, the United Kingdom is the only country other than the United States hosting\\nnumerous, very large broker-dealers that are owned by foreign banks and also a broad array\\nof commercial bank subsidiaries and branches that are owned by foreign banks. In fact, the\\nsix institutions headquartered outside the United States and the United Kingdom that are in\\nthe top three tiers of G-SIBs hold roughly 40 percent of their worldwide assets in those two\\njurisdictions.12 Thus the U.K. initiative on liquidity and its internal debates on matters such as\\nstructural supervision, the Vickers proposals, and stress testing have all been very instructive\\nfor the Federal Reserve Board. Even where we have eventually adopted somewhat different\\napproaches, we respect the motivation and scrupulousness of the U.K. banking authorities in\\naddressing the systemic vulnerabilities posed by FBOs and in fulfilling their responsibility to\\nthe rest of the world to assure the stability of one of the world's two most important financial\\ncenters.\\nUnlike the EU, the United States did not - prior to the financial crisis - require that all\\nbrokerdealers and investment banks meet Basel capital standards. The legacy of the\\nGlassSteagall Act, which had separated investment banking from commercial banking, meant that\\nonly commercial banks were subject to the prudential regulation of the federal banking\\nagencies. In Europe, the dominance of universal banking, or variants thereon, led more\\nnaturally to application of capital and other prudential standards to all forms of banking\\nactivity. Even after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the remaining barriers to affiliation\\nbetween investment banks and commercial banks in the United States, Basel capital\\nrequirements applied at a consolidated level to the activities of an investment bank or\\nbrokerdealer only if it did affiliate with a commercial bank. Thus, the five large \\\"free-standing\\\" U.S.\\ninvestment banks were generally not subject to full application of Basel capital standards.\\nDuring the crisis, the ill-advised nature of this regulatory state of affairs became apparent.\\nThe decline in value of many mortgage-backed securities and the consequent market\\nuncertainty as to the true value of that entire class of securities raised questions about the\\nsolvency of major broker-dealers. Because the dealers were so highly leveraged and\\ndependent on short-term financing, the uncertainty also led to serious liquidity strains, first at\\nBear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and eventually at most dealers - domestic and foreign\\nowned. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were acquired by existing bank holding companies\\nafter coming close to failure. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan\\nStanley became bank holding companies.\\nThrough its Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Federal Reserve provided substantial liquidity\\nto the broker-dealer affiliates of the bank holding companies, as well as to the primary dealer\\nsubsidiaries of foreign banks. At the same time, the shift in strategy of many foreign banks\\ntoward using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around the\\nworld created another set of vulnerabilities that resulted in substantial and, relative to total\\nassets, disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve's discount window by foreign bank\\nbranches.\\nThe experience of the crisis made clear, first, that the perimeter of prudential regulation\\naround U.S. financial institutions needed to be expanded. As noted a moment ago, this had\\noccurred de facto during the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act has given a legal foundation for this\\nchange, first by mandating that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will remain subject to\\nconsolidated prudential regulation even were they to divest their insured depository\\ninstitutions and, second, by giving the Financial Stability Oversight Council the authority to\\ndesignate other financial firms as systemically important, a step that would place them under\\nFederal Reserve regulation and supervision. Dodd-Frank further required the Federal\\nReserve to apply progressively more stringent prudential regulation to bank holding\\ncompanies with more than $50 billion in assets.\\nCongress also required the Federal Reserve to apply special prudential standards to large\\nFBOs. As I have already implied, much of what we have done is simply to catch up to EU\\nand U.K. practice. Under our recently finalized Section 165 enhanced prudential standards\\nregulation, an FBO with U.S. non-branch assets of $50 billion or more must hold its U.S.\\nsubsidiaries under an intermediate holding company (IHC), which must meet the risk-based\\nand leverage capital standards generally applicable to bank holding companies under U.S.\\nlaw.13 Such an FBO must also certify that it meets consolidated capital adequacy standards\\nestablished by its home-country supervisor that are consistent with the Basel Capital\\nFramework. FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must also meet liquidity\\nrisk-management standards and conduct internal liquidity stress tests. The IHC must\\nmaintain a liquidity buffer in the United States for a 30-day liquidity stress test. The U.S.\\nbranches and agencies of an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal\\nto the liquidity needs for 14 days, as determined by a 30-day liquidity stress test.14 The IHCs\\nof FBOs must also conform to certain risk-management and supervisory requirements at the\\nIHC level.\\nStructurally, the U.S. capital requirements for FBOs are similar to those that apply to foreign\\nbanks in the EU. That is, generally applicable Basel capital requirements are applied to the\\nU.S. operations of FBOs that own local banking subsidiaries, investment banks, and\\nbrokerdealers. In fact, the new U.S. rules are somewhat more favorable to foreign institutions, in\\nthat they only apply once the non-branch U.S. assets of an FBO exceed $50 billion. That\\ndollar amount, incidentally, is the same as the Dodd-Frank threshold for more stringent\\nprudential measures, though note that this statutory threshold applies if the total assets of\\nany U.S. banking organization - foreign, as well as domestic - exceed that level. As in the\\nEU, the capital requirements do not apply to U.S. branches of foreign banks, even though the\\ncrisis experience provides some credible arguments for doing so.\\nThe leverage ratio requirement has received particular attention. One complaint is that the\\nforeign operations of U.S. banks are not subject to leverage ratios for their local operations. It\\nis true that many foreign countries - including the EU member states - do not currently have\\nleverage ratio standards for their banks. As noted earlier, however, one may reasonably\\nexpect that those countries will be implementing the Basel III leverage ratio in a timely\\nfashion. Also, I would note in passing that the U.S. leverage ratio requirement for foreign\\nfirms will be phased in more slowly than originally proposed, so as to align it more closely\\nwith the effective date of the Basel III leverage ratio requirement.\\nA second complaint is that there is something unfair about the United States requiring an\\nFBO to meet the international leverage ratio in its U.S. operations, because its operations\\nmay be heavily weighted toward broker-dealer activities, which generally have higher\\nleverage, whereas the leverage ratio for U.S. firms is based on their global operations. Again,\\none suspects that the foreign operations of U.S. firms could be subject to a similar ratio\\nrequirement abroad as countries implement their Basel III commitments. However, quite\\napart from what may happen in the future, there are two U.S.-based firms - Goldman Sachs\\nand Morgan Stanley - whose global business mix resembles that of the U.S. subsidiaries of\\nFBOs that are predominantly engaged in broker-dealer activities in the United States. In fact,\\nunder the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio the Board proposed during the summer,\\nthese and other U.S. G-SIBs would be subject to a higher Basel III leverage ratio\\nrequirement (5 percent) than would apply to FBO IHCs (3 percent).\\nThe applicable liquidity requirements, while somewhat differently defined, are roughly\\ncomparable to those already applicable to FBOs in the United Kingdom. The similar positions\\nof our two nations as host countries for foreign bank operations heavily involved in trading\\nand significantly reliant on potentially runnable short-term wholesale funding explain this\\nrough parallelism.\\nThe most notable departure of the new U.S. FBO standards from existing EU and U.K.\\npractice lies in the IHC requirement for foreign banks with large domestic operations. Given\\nthe structure of U.S. financial regulation that is a legacy of Glass-Steagall, as well as the\\nefforts by a small number of very large foreign banks to evade the intent of Congress that\\ncapital standards apply to their U.S. operations, we needed to create this structural\\nrequirement. It is unclear how much difference this makes for the capital requirements of\\nFBOs in the United States as opposed, say, to those of U.S. operations in the EU. That\\nwould depend on the existence and size of financial affiliates owned by the U.S. firm that are\\nnot subject to Basel standards directly. In any case, it seems sound prudential practice - and\\nconsistent with the various Basel Committee principles to which I earlier referred - that large\\ndomestic operations of foreign banks meet capital standards on the basis of all exposures in\\nthe host jurisdiction and, indeed, that they manage their risks in that country across all their\\naffiliates.\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" and home-host responsibilities\\nTo return to the issue of Balkanization, three things should now be apparent. First, in its new\\ncapital regulations applicable to FBOs, the United States is more a follower of the pattern set\\nby the EU than it is an initiator of new kinds of requirements. Of course, a few foreign banks\\nwould prefer the old system under which they held relatively little capital in their very\\nextensive U.S. operations. But that was neither safe for the financial system nor particularly\\nfair to their competitors - U.S. and foreign - that hold significant amounts of capital here.\\nIndeed, a firm that is genuinely well capitalized, including holding the G-SIB surcharge at its\\nglobal consolidated level, should require only moderate adjustment efforts during the\\ntransition period established in the FBO rule.\\nSecond, there is considerable scope for a foreign bank to integrate its U.S. operations with\\nits global activities within the rule the Federal Reserve adopted last month. For example,\\nwhile foreign firms with more than $10 billion in non-branch assets have some additional\\nreporting requirements, only when U.S. non-branch assets rise above $50 billion do the\\nquantitative Basel capital requirements become applicable to the U.S. subsidiaries.\\nMoreover, no capital requirements apply to branches so long as their parent is subject to\\nhome-country consolidated capital rules consistent with Basel standards. The U.S.\\noperations of FBO branches and subsidiaries will not be subject to \\\"due from\\\" restrictions.\\nThey remain free to lend money to their worldwide affiliates; they must simply do so with a\\nmore stable funding base. Finally, I note that many FBOs, like many U.S.-based banks, have\\nmade considerable progress in reducing dependence on short-term wholesale funding and in\\nbuilding capital. To some extent, the new requirements are intended to preserve this\\nprogress.\\nThird, the capital and liquidity requirements that do apply are wholly consistent with the\\nresponsibility of host-country supervisors to assure financial stability in their own markets.\\nCollectively, foreign banks with a large presence in the United States conduct activities of a\\nscope, and at a scale, that could lead to problems for the U.S. financial system should they\\ncome under stress. Realistically, exposures and vulnerabilities in a large host-country market\\nare much more difficult for home-country supervisors to assess. Indeed, U.S. regulators\\ncount on the expertise and proximity of U.K. regulators in overseeing the London operations\\nof large U.S. financial institutions to enhance the effective consolidated supervision and\\nregulation for which we are responsible.\\nOn the issue of home-host-country coordination in regulating large, globally active banking\\norganizations, I would make three additional points. First, our FBO capital requirements, like\\nthose of the EU for foreign commercial and investment banks, are based on the capital rules\\nagreed to in the Basel Committee.15 Thus, there is an overall compatibility between national\\nand international rules with respect to applicable definitions, standards, and required ratios.\\nSecond, home countries must implement and enforce faithfully at a consolidated level these\\nsame capital rules. More broadly, home-country supervisory expectations for strong\\nconsolidated capital levels, liquidity positions, and risk-management practices are likely to\\nfacilitate compliance with domestic requirements for large FBOs of the sort applicable in the\\nUnited States and the EU. It is also important that home countries assure the credibility of\\nresolution mechanisms for their large banking organizations. This task entails the\\nimplementation of the Financial Stability Board's principles for effective resolution regimes,\\nincluding establishing a resolution authority with adequate legal powers to manage the\\nprocess in an orderly fashion without injection of public capital.16 It also includes requiring\\neach such institution to have total loss absorption capacity sufficient to recapitalize the firm\\neven if its substantial equity buffer is lost in an extreme tail event. Home and host countries\\nshould work together toward international standards that will ensure that an appropriate\\namount of this capacity would be available to host authorities faced with the potential\\ninsolvency of large FBOs in their jurisdiction or with the consequences for their market of the\\nfailure of parent banks.\\nIn this regard, I think that capital requirements for FBOs of the sort now required by the EU\\nand the United States are very likely to reduce the considerable strains that have traditionally\\naccompanied financial distress at global banking firms. In most cases, including both\\ninternationally and within the EU itself in recent years, stress has resulted in the demand by\\nhost authorities for ex post ring fencing of capital, liquidity, or both, often in the absence of\\nany ex ante requirements. The existence of FBO capital and liquidity standards, particularly if\\nsupplemented with the total loss absorbency measures to which I just referred, should\\nmitigate the need for such demands, which of course come at the worst possible time for the\\nfirm trying to meet them.\\nThird, we - by which I mean both home and major host banking regulators - need to find\\nbetter ways of fostering genuine regulatory and supervisory cooperation. Particularly at the\\nmost senior levels of the agencies that actually supervise globally active banks, our\\ninteractions with our counterparts from other countries have become almost exclusively\\nfocused on developing international standards or reviewing compliance with existing ones.\\nThese discussions are usually conducted with numerous colleagues who are not themselves\\nresponsible for banking regulation in their own jurisdictions. As important as these efforts\\nhave been, and continue to be, following the crisis, there is a risk that by not having\\nopportunities for senior officials of the various national agencies that have direct supervisory\\nresponsibility for banking organizations to meet and discuss shared challenges, we give\\nshort shrift to the collective interest of bank regulators in effective supervision of all globally\\nactive firms. Proposals to include prudential requirements or, more precisely, to include\\nlimitations on prudential requirements in trade agreements would lead us farther away from\\nthe aforementioned goal of emphasizing shared financial stability interests, in favor of an\\napproach to prudential matters informed principally by considerations of commercial\\nadvantage.\\nConclusion\\nThe job of regulating and supervising large, globally active banking organizations is a tough\\none. Issues of moral hazard, negative externalities, and asymmetric information are, if not\\npervasive, then at least significant and recurring. The job is made only harder by the fact that\\nthese firms cross borders in ways their regulators do not. But we cannot ignore this fact and\\npretend that we have global oversight. International standards for prudential regulation are\\nnot the same as global regulations, and consolidated supervision is not the same as\\ncomprehensive supervision. The jurisdictions represented on the Basel Committee not only\\nhave the right to regulate their financial markets - including large FBOs participating in those\\nmarkets - they have a responsibility to their home jurisdictions, and to the rest of the world,\\nto do so. The most important contribution the United States can make to global financial\\nstability is to ensure the stability of our own financial system.\\nThere must be some assurance beyond mere words from parent banks or home-country\\nsupervisors that a large FBO will remain strong or supported in periods of stress. After all, as\\nwe saw in the crisis, while a parent bank or home-country authorities may have offered those\\nwords with total good faith in calm times, they may be unable to carry through on them in\\nmore financially turbulent periods. None of this means that we need be at odds with one\\nanother. On the contrary, these very circumstances call not only for more tangible\\nsafeguards in host countries, but also for more genuine cooperation among supervisory\\nauthorities. Indeed, as I hope will continue to be the case with the international agenda on\\nresolution, total loss absorbency, and related matters, we should aspire to converge around\\nthe kinds of protections that we can expect at both consolidated and local levels.\\nBIS central bankers' speeches 11\",\n          \"William C Dudley: The national and regional economic outlook\\nRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal\\nReserve Bank of New York, at the University at Albany, Albany, New York, 18 November 2011.\\n* * *\\nGood morning. I am pleased to be at the University at Albany. It is always a pleasure to\\nspeak with students and faculty because of the intellectual leadership role you play in your\\ncommunities. I also welcome the addition of business leaders to this gathering because you\\nshape the economic landscape in the region. So, I thank you all for coming today and helping\\nmake this such a rich audience.\\nOver the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across\\nmy Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to\\nWashington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international\\nbank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure\\nthat my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As\\nyou may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in\\nnorthern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\nIn August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark,\\nPatterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and\\nPuerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\\nMy trip started yesterday with a policy speech to the West Point cadets and was followed by\\na colloquium with their economics faculty. So, this visit to the upper Hudson Valley brings me\\nin contact with some of our country's future leaders - you and the cadets who will lead our\\ncountry in very important, if different, ways.\\nI will also have a chance to see more of what makes Albany so distinct from both downstate\\nand Upstate New York. Of course, I may have a leg up on this because I was born and\\nraised close by, in western Massachusetts!\\nThe greater Albany area is home to 900,000 people - roughly the size of three average cities\\nin the United States. You and your fellow residents tend to be highly educated and be\\nemployed as public servants. These factors are all part of what makes Albany feel special.\\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed - what we do and why we do it. Then I'll\\ngive you my views on the economy nationally and locally. It's a serious issue because it\\naffects your family and students' job prospects at graduation time.\\nWhat the New York Fed does\\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my\\njob so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily\\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as\\nthe FOMC.\\nI am vice chair of the FOMC - a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in\\nWashington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The\\nmembers of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by\\nCongress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.\\nSometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should\\nview this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions - particularly at times like this -\\nand we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are\\nunited in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential\\nto the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term\\npolitical pressures.\\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region\\nand the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical\\ninformation that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils\\nand community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. This trip includes\\nmeetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global Foundries (an advanced\\nmicroprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic Development Council, and the\\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a\\nnumber of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of\\neconomic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are\\nessentially local measures of output - similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the\\nnational level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the\\nemployment report, which is the only other available metric at the state level. We have also\\nstarted a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount\\nand type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a\\ntimely way.\\nIn addition, we have a new poll about credit and financing for small businesses, the latter are\\nan important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and\\nreasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011\\npoll, of which nearly 15 percent were from the upstate region. The next poll will be in\\nJanuary. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll,\\nplease pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\\nNext month, we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses\\n- to provide information about how they can participate in the global economy and expand\\ntheir companies by exporting their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small\\nBusiness Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce will be on hand. They will\\ntell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government\\nprograms are available to enhance credit, reduce payment risk and increase lines of working\\ncapital. We are also facilitating a \\\"speed mentoring\\\" forum in which small businesses will\\nreceive feedback on their business plans and advice about applying for financing from a\\nrange of finance professionals.\\nIn 2012, we're planning similar events in the capital region. We hope to partner with many of\\nyou to support the small business sector.\\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we\\ntarget some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked\\nhard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we\\nhave provided housing advocates, including the Empire Justice Center, with the latest\\ninformation on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters.\\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit\\nnewyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business,\\ncredit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our\\ncolleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial\\nsystem on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at\\nit. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual - whether on\\nthe part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\\nNational economic conditions\\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\\nWe stand here today several years after the worst financial crisis in modern times. The\\norigins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had\\ngrown to great size during the middle part of the last decade.\\nPrior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and imbalanced\\nglobal economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide. This was particularly\\nextreme in certain markets such as U.S. housing and housing finance.\\nThis mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive build-up of debt\\nin many parts of the global economy. Many - though not all - U.S. households responded to\\nthe easy availability of credit and rising home prices by taking on more debt. When the\\nhousing boom lost steam and began to burst, expectations about housing prices and wealth\\nwere disappointed. The bursting of the credit bubble also created instability within the global\\nfinancial system and, this, in turn resulted in a sharp drop in the credit available to\\nhouseholds and businesses.\\nThe result was what is now called the \\\"Great Recession\\\". Over the period from late 2007\\nthrough mid-2009, real GDP declined by more than 5 percent, making this recession the\\nlongest and deepest recession of the postwar period.\\nThe recession was felt in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe impact it\\nhad on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the recession, contributing to a\\nsharp rise in the unemployment rate from around 4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over\\n10 percent in October 2009.\\nExtraordinary actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve,\\nprevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy stabilized\\naround mid-2009. But since then the recovery has been bifurcated. While emerging\\neconomies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown only slowly. This has\\nhastened a historic shift in the balance of economic power that was already underway before\\nthe crisis.\\nIn the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than expected.\\nGrowth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment significantly or to achieve a\\nself-reinforcing cycle of strengthening confidence, demand, income and employment.\\nAlthough the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from\\nearlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very weak first half,\\nwhen GDP growth was less than 1 percent, economic activity has strengthened somewhat\\nand inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated\\nto be 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be\\nsomewhat higher. This modest rebound reflects in part the passing of transitory factors such\\nas the damping effect on household and business spending power from rises in energy and\\nfood prices as well as the supply disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\\nHowever, as we look toward 2012, the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to\\na robust recovery. Accordingly I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012.\\nConsumer price inflation has begun to moderate. This moderation is just starting to become\\nevident on a 12-month time horizon - in which consumer price inflation as measured by the\\nconsumer price index (CPI) is rising at about a 3.5 percent annual rate. Given current\\nexpectations for the path of energy prices - taken from futures markets - consumer price\\ninflation on a year-over-year basis should continue to fall over the next few months.\\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few\\nyears. The economy is operating far below its productive potential - leaving the level of\\noutput, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy's unused\\nresources were put to work. One summary statistic says it all - the unemployment rate is\\nunacceptably high at 9 percent. Given my outlook, the decline of unemployment over the\\nnext year is likely to be modest. Furthermore, we also continue to face significant downside\\nrisks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\\nIn a speech yesterday at West Point, I highlighted the need for our nation to deploy a full set\\nof economic policy tools to secure the recovery and build for the long term. This includes\\nmonetary policy, but also requires policies to help repair housing markets, fiscal policy that\\nsupports growth in the short and long run, and structural reforms that increase\\ncompetitiveness and support a shift in the pattern of economic activity toward a more\\nsustainable growth path than that which prevailed during the last business cycle upswing.\\nRegional economic conditions\\nHow is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York\\nFed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor conditions in New York State.1\\nBased on our index, the downturn in the state's economy ended in November of 2009. Since\\nthen, I would describe the state's economy as recovering at a moderate pace, although there\\nappears to have been a pause in September.\\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to learn about\\nconditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that November's report (issued\\nthis Tuesday) shows signs of stabilizing after five months of weakening. In November, more\\nmanufacturers are adopting an optimistic outlook.\\nLike many other large states, New York has a bifurcated economy. New York's downstate\\narea differs dramatically from the upstate area in terms of industrial composition, occupations\\nand job growth. While Albany may be geographically midway between the two areas, its\\nindustry mix resembles neither the downstate's heavy concentration in the service sector, nor\\nthe upstate focus on the manufacturing sector. What sets Albany apart is that it is home to\\nthe state's capital. About one quarter of employees in the Albany area work for the\\ngovernment - about a third more than the statewide average.\\nThe local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this recession, but\\nthe impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well established. During the downturn,\\nthe capital region saw a loss of about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment,\\nconsiderably less severe than the 6.5 percent nationwide decline. Over the past year and a\\nhalf, job losses have slowed. But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently\\nsay that a solid recovery is underway. The Albany area is not yet consistently adding jobs.\\nThis is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced by New York State. The state\\nhas cut a considerable number of government jobs and reduced other expenditures as part\\nof its effort to close significant budget gaps. These job reductions have disproportionately\\nslowed Albany's local economy.2\\nIn contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany's private sector is showing signs of recovery.\\nYour private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to offset the public\\nsector job losses. However, this job creation has not been robust enough to bring down the\\nunemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent of the workforce. That is a lower rate of\\nunemployment than the national rate, as is usual for Albany. However, it is almost double the\\njobless rate in early 2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended. It will be\\ndifficult for growth in the region's economy to resume and for unemployment to decline until\\nthe public sector stabilizes.\\nAn important plus for the local economy is the capital region's housing sector, which has\\nweathered the economic storm relatively well. As a result, the drop-off in economic activity\\nthat is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not\\nbeen as severe here as it has been in many other places around the country. Like much of\\nUpstate New York, Albany's housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of\\nthe country. During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany's house prices rose by 85 percent,\\nmuch higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate New York as a whole\\nand almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen nationally. Unlike the rest of the\\nnation, though, the region's housing market has been comparatively stable since then. Prices\\nhave declined by about 7 percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of\\n32 percent nationally.\\nNonetheless, declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased\\nfinancial pressures on families. During the recession, all across the nation, high levels of debt\\nled to a soaring number of delinquencies. Many families found that they needed to reduce\\ntheir debt to more sustainable levels.\\nDrawing on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that these\\ntrends have certainly affected people in this area.3 But the good news is that the effects have\\nnot been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country. Households in the Albany\\nregion did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest of the state and\\ncountry during the run-up to the crisis. Recent data indicate that the average adult in Albany\\nhas about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20 percent lower than the average across the\\nstate and country as a whole. Thus, financial strains on many families in the Albany area\\nwere lower than in many other places around the state and nation.\\nHowever, the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the area,\\nso it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures. About 4 percent of debt\\nbalances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany, which is twice the 2 percent delinquency\\nrate in 2005. Although this is less than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this\\ndoubling of delinquencies in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress\\nfor many families here.\\nStepping back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of\\nfundamental strengths. These strengths show through in some key ways:\\n\\uf0b7 Albany is growing. The recent Census shows that the population in the region\\nexpanded by 5.5 percent over the past decade, more than double the statewide\\naverage. Saratoga County saw an especially strong gain of nearly 10 percent.\\n\\uf0b7 Incomes in the region are high. Albany is the state's most affluent area outside the\\nNew York City metropolitan region. Median household income was roughly $57,000\\nin 2009, moderately above the statewide median and well above the nation's. Not\\nsurprisingly, then, the poverty rate is lower than the U.S. average - 11 percent\\nversus 14 percent nationally.\\n\\uf0b7 Your residents are highly educated. Educational attainment - a critically important\\ndriver of economic activity - is also well above the national average. A third of adults\\nwho live in the Albany area hold college degrees.\\nOne of Albany's key strengths is its higher education industry. The colleges and universities\\nin the capital region help stabilize the local economy during downturns and recoveries.\\nIndeed, the private education sector continually added jobs before, during, and after the\\nGreat Recession, both nationally and locally. For example, the University at Albany has\\ntaken a lead role in shaping the next generation of financial professionals and regulators\\nthrough its pioneering curriculums. From my perspective at the Fed, a particularly important\\nand timely example is the University's innovative National Science Foundation-supported\\nprogram for instruction and research in financial market regulation.\\nResearch conducted by the New York Fed has shown that colleges and universities can help\\nbuild the skills and education of their region's workforce, which is critical to an area's ultimate\\neconomic success.4 They do this in two ways. Most directly, colleges and universities support\\nan educated workforce by producing new college graduates, some of whom will stay and\\nwork in the area. The University at Albany clearly plays this role in the capital area.\\nPerhaps equally important in terms of promoting local economic growth, colleges and\\nuniversities can play a key role in creating jobs for skilled workers in local businesses.\\nColleges and universities conduct research and development that can have \\\"spillover effects\\\"\\ninto the local economy. Businesses in the region can take advantage of being close to these\\ninnovative activities and facilities to develop new products and technologies. This can also\\nhelp draw new companies to the region to access university resources. Thus, successful\\nindustry-higher education partnerships can provide a quite a boost for a region's economy.\\nThe local nanotech sector provides an excellent example of this type of partnership at work.\\nDuring my visit to the University's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering this\\nafternoon I look forward to seeing the facilities and hearing more about the Center's plans to\\nlead the way in global nanotech research. More broadly, I understand that our audience\\ntoday includes several members of the Regional Economic Advisory Council - including the\\nUniversity at Albany's president, George Philip and Michael Castellana, the co-chair of the\\nCouncil - who are working to advance such partnerships and the outlook for the region.\\nGoing forward, the industry-higher education partnerships taking place here will be\\nincreasingly important. I expect the strong foundation already in place will help maintain the\\neconomic vitality of the capital region.\\nConclusion\\nTo sum up, growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to\\nbring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the\\nfinancial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which\\nhas risen in recent months, is poised to moderate soon. The Fed is doing - and will continue\\nto do - everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\\nLooking ahead, the key challenge for the Albany area will be to continue to prepare its\\nresidents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding education and skills will go a long\\nway to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\\nThank you for your kind attention.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data preprocess - merging\n","\n","In this step, we will preprocess the Federal Reserve Speeches dataset to prepare it for analysis.

This gathering comes a few weeks after the announcement\\nof this year's stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the highlights of those results.\\nThey show that our financial system remains resilient and that capital planning by banks\\ncontinues to improve. The largest and most complex banks were tested against a severe\\nhypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well above their minimum\\nrequirements. They demonstrated the ability to withstand a severe and lasting economic\\ndownturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses. Additionally, most firms are\\nnow meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure capital planning takes into account\\ntheir specific risks and vulnerabilities. This is an improvement from last year. Overall, these\\nresults are good news that confirm our financial system is significantly stronger than before the\\ncrisis.\\nNow let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our understanding of the\\nexperience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to think about the future. And let\\nme begin by acknowledging that-notwithstanding our openness to learning from the collective\\nexperience of all of us in this room-the future of stress testing will, in a number of important\\nways, necessarily resemble the past. For example, we're still going to have them. Over the\\ncourse of the last 18 months, I have heard overwhelmingly-from academics, from think tanks of\\nevery stripe, from banks of every size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreign-\\nthat stress tests should continue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve's supervision of\\nsystemically important banks and a key aspect of the Fed's efforts to promote financial stability.\\nStress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic. And the banks' performance on these\\ntests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the affected\\nbanks' capital requirements.\\nTransparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental principle of the\\nfirst stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a primary goal. Stress tests,\\nas ever, will provide the public with essential information to assess the health of banks and the\\noverall financial system. To be credible, stress tests will also continue to provide significant\\ninformation about how the Fed does its work, so the public can understand the rigor and\\nindependence of our assessment process and how we come to our judgment of the firms we\\ntest.\\nFidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress test a decade\\nago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn't changed over the\\nyears. We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and added useful features and\\nadjustments. These include a counterparty default scenario, as well as a number of policy\\nstatements that more explicitly convey the principles we find important in a sensible stress\\ntesting program.\\nStress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as supervisors learn\\nfrom our work and what we can learn from others. Each year, we have refined both the\\nsubstance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own experience and by critiques\\nand suggestions from others. This feedback comes from a variety sources, including\\nconferences such as this one, and I am confident that the presentations today will provide\\ninsights that result in improvements in our stress tests.\\nIf stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that they must\\ncontinue to change: they must respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and the\\nrisk-management capabilities of firms. Evolutionary change has been a consistent principle of\\nstress testing since the beginning, embraced by my predecessors at the Board of Governors\\nand our supervisory staff and reflected in each cycle of tests. Without such adjustments,\\nregulators, banks, and the broader public cannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital\\npositions of the largest banks.\\nStress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around the capital\\nadequacy of our largest banks. Stress tests results should allow investors, counterparties,\\nanalysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the condition of banks. Along with\\nother regulatory measures, this transparency increases market discipline and it subjects the\\nFederal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and analysis. Accountability is important not only for\\nthe usual reasons that apply in a democracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only\\nbe effective when the public has confidence in the Fed's evaluation of the capital adequacy of\\nbanks. In effect, stress tests are also a test of the Fed's supervision of large banks.\\nIn these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk management, the\\neconomy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to stress tests over the past\\ndecade. Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which is a founding principle for\\nstress tests. I will then suggest some ways in which the effectiveness of stress testing can be\\nfurther enhanced with greater transparency.\\nTen years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the first stress\\ntest results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP). At that moment, the\\nU.S. economy was in free fall. The United States had lost an astonishing three million jobs in the\\nprevious four months. One significant reason for these losses was that many businesses were\\nseverely constrained in their access to funding and found it impossible to predict when that\\naccess might improve. The goal of the first test was urgent and simple: to restore confidence in\\nthe 19 large banks that then accounted for two-thirds of the assets in the banking system. In fact,\\nsimply announcing in March that there would be tests helped stabilize bank finances. That\\nimprovement continued after the results in May outlined the quite feasible steps for raising\\nadditional capital that the banks would need to take, and did take, to be able to continue lending if\\nadverse conditions continued. Challenging conditions did continue, but the stress tests and other\\nactions taken in the first half of 2009 marked a turning point. The recovery from the Great\\nRecession began in July, as the financial system came back to life, and then steadily\\nstrengthened.\\nThe principles that made that first test so effective were independence and transparency. For the\\nfirst time, an independent authority, the Federal Reserve, would seek to independently assess\\n1\\nrisks. Just as important, the details of that assessment would be shared with the public, an\\nextent of transparency that until then wasn't characteristic of bank supervision but would become\\nthe hallmark of the regulatory framework erected in response to the crisis. The first tests relied\\nheavily on banks' internal risk models, but they still represented a huge step in independence in\\nproviding the public with an assessment of the health and resiliency of large banks.\\nTransparency facilitated both market discipline and accountability. The information provided to\\nthe public under the SCAP stress test reinforced the entire enterprise of estimating the capital\\nshortfall faced by major banks. It held the banks accountable for information on their capital\\nadequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.\\nThe next big step for stress testing came with its integration with the Federal Reserve's\\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning in 2011. One big change from\\nthe initial SCAP test was that stress tests were no longer a one-time emergency measure\\nintended to restore confidence in major financial institutions. Instead, they became a recurring,\\nongoing process intended to maintain confidence in major institutions. Second, stress tests were\\nno longer a discretionary exercise by supervisors-under Dodd-Frank, they became the law of\\nthe land. And third, when they were integrated into CCAR, stress tests became part of a\\ncomprehensive-it's the first C in CCAR-framework for capital planning that more closely\\nconnected capital regulation to risk management of banks and overall supervision.\\nThese were changes, but with the effect of reinforcing the founding principles of the SCAP test.\\nTransparency was enhanced when stress tests became mandatory, recurring events and the\\npublic could depend on continuing to have access to information about banks' capital adequacy.\\nAlso, the independence of those judgments was enhanced when Congress made them a\\nstatutory responsibility for the Fed and when they were integrated into our CCAR framework.\\nFurther changes to stress testing have likewise reinforced the original goals. Stress testing\\nscenarios have become richer and more challenging, providing more information about how\\nbanks would deal with a range of adverse developments and, for example, exploring the effects\\nof more differentiated risks that are not tied to the business cycle. Large trading banks now face\\nan instantaneous shock to their trading assets, and many participants in the stress tests now\\nmust address how they would respond to the failure of their largest counterparty.\\nOur stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand a severe\\nrecession. The capital-building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete, but as part of\\nCCAR, stress testing continues to contribute to the significant and ongoing improvement since\\n2009 in risk management by banks. The original reason for the qualitative objection aspect of\\nstress testing was to provide incentives for banks to address the risk-management\\nshortcomings that the Federal Reserve had observed during the financial crisis. For example,\\nmany firms supervised by the Federal Reserve had substantial deficiencies in their ability to\\nmeasure, monitor, and manage their risks. These shortcomings made it difficult for banks to\\naccurately report their risk exposures to the Board, and consequently, threatened to undermine\\nthe credibility of the stress tests, which were, and remain, dependent on data from the banks.\\nSince the beginning of CCAR in 2011, large banks have significantly improved their\\nriskmanagement and capital-planning processes. The qualitative assessment conducted as part of\\nthe 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles found that most firms either meet or are very close to meeting\\nthe Federal Reserve's supervisory expectations for capital planning. Large banks have improved\\nthe methods they use to identify their unique risks, now use sound practices for identifying and\\naddressing model weaknesses, and have strong processes in place to evaluate their capital\\npositions on a forward-looking basis. While we continue to perform a qualitative assessment and\\nensure that progress is retained, the improvements led the Federal Reserve to conclude that for\\nmost banks this assessment can be incorporated into our regular supervisory practices. The\\nevolution of our qualitative assessment reflects the experience of the past 10 years of stress\\ntesting, and in particular, the great improvement in risk management by large banks and the\\ncumulative effect of the Fed's improved supervision of large institutions. As I said earlier, for\\nstress testing to remain effective, it must respond to changes in the economy, the financial\\nsystem, and risk-management capabilities.\\nThe changes to CCAR have occurred in the context of a similarly dramatic improvement in the\\nstrength and resilience of the financial system. The firms have more than doubled their capital\\nsince the first round of stress tests in 2009. Since that time, the common equity of the largest 18\\nfirms has increased by more than $650 billion.\\nLet me now turn to the most recent changes to CCAR and stress testing and put them in the\\ncontext of the history I have just related. Congress revisited large bank supervision last year in S.\\n2155, yet the legislation it passed reaffirmed the important role of stress testing. This shouldn't\\nbe surprising, because the experience of stress testing over the last 10 years has demonstrated\\nthat it is a highly useful element of large bank supervision and the promotion of financial stability.\\nSomething else that shouldn't be surprising is that this experience has revealed that periodic\\nstress testing has turned out to be a less useful supervisory tool to evaluate the risks of smaller\\nand less complex financial institutions. Congress made use of this experience by raising the\\nthreshold for stress testing to $100 billion in assets and providing more flexibility for the Fed to\\ntailor stress testing for all firms. This step has, once again, advanced the principles\\ndemonstrated in the first stress test and ever since. It has increased transparency because\\nincorporating and disclosing what we have learned about the varying effectiveness of stress\\ntesting at different types of institutions is making stress testing more effective. The accountability\\nof the Fed is enhanced when we are seen taking on board what we have learned through\\nsuccessive cycles of stress tests, and this strengthens the independence and credibility of our\\njudgments. For those of us who believe stress testing should remain central to supervision and\\npromoting financial stability, it is vital that an adjustment such as this takes place as appropriate.\\nWith that in mind, let me review recent changes and proposed changes to the Federal Reserve's\\nstress testing. These changes are designed to make CCAR more transparent and simple and to\\nfeature less unnecessary volatility.\\nThe first principle is transparency. We have taken a number of recent steps to enhance the\\ntransparency around our models and the stress testing process more generally. Earlier this year,\\nthe Board published enhanced disclosures on two of the key models that we use in stress\\ntesting. In addition, the Board published estimated loss rates for groups of loans with distinct\\ncharacteristics, to show how supervisory models treat specific assets under stress. We will\\npublish disclosures about two additional models in 2020 and each year thereafter until we have\\nprovided transparency about all our stress test models. At the same time, we published a new\\npolicy statement on our approach to supervisory stress testing. Among other things, the\\nstatement emphasizes the importance of independence and stability to the credibility of our\\nstress tests.\\nWe are currently considering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and\\nscenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and\\npossible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and salient risks facing the\\nbanking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the\\nscenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios, and a range of other\\nenhancements.\\nSome argue that the greater transparency and disclosure promoted by recent changes and\\n2\\nproposed changes to stress testing amounts to providing banks with the answers to the tests.\\nThis both overstates the extent of disclosure involved and misunderstands what we are trying to\\naccomplish in stress testing-goals that haven't changed since the spring of 2009.\\nIf the goal were only to conduct a test that was difficult to pass-like the qualifying exams for\\nsome of the more esoteric and restrictive high-IQ societies-then trying to explain principles,\\nscenario design, and how models work would be inappropriate. If the measure of success for the\\nFed in administering a stress test was simply how many banks failed, then greater transparency\\nwould indeed be a mistake. But that is not the purpose of stress testing, and it never has been.\\nThe vitally important goal is to improve and sustain good risk management and capital planning\\nat the individual institutions we supervise and to promote the stability of the financial system. Like\\na teacher, we don't want banks to fail, we want them to learn. In this case, we want them to learn\\ngood risk management in the context of forward-looking capital planning. This will provide the\\npublic with more information about the capital planning of major banks, and about how the\\nFederal Reserve views good capital planning and risk management, bolstering our credibility.\\nThe second principle reflected in recent changes to stress testing is simplicity. One important\\nproposal-what we are calling the stress capital buffer-would simplify the Fed's large bank\\ncapital rule by integrating the stress testing process with our traditional regulatory capital rules.\\nOur regulatory capital rule includes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on\\ntop of those minimum requirements. The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to\\nsupervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the\\nminimum requirements. Integrating these two standards is a natural evolution of CCAR away\\nfrom its origins during the crisis, when such tailoring was impractical and policy makers had not\\nyet considered the approach of a regulatory capital buffer on top of a regulatory capital minimum.\\nThe stress capital buffer would result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory\\ncapital requirements because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.\\nThe stress capital buffer would not reduce the stringency of the regulatory capital framework for\\nlarge banks, but it would effect a substantial simplification of that framework. By my math, the\\nnumber of different capital requirements applicable to large banks would fall from 18 to eight and\\nthe number of different total loss absorbing capacity requirements for large banks would fall from\\n24 to 14. I expect that we will move forward with a revised stress capital buffer proposal in the\\nnear future, reflecting many of the comments received on our original proposal.\\nThe third principle addressed by the recent changes is volatility. When I think about volatility in\\nstress testing, I want to distinguish what I consider to be useful variation in the tests, in the form\\nof exploration of salient risks, from what I consider to be less useful variation, in the form of\\nunexpected swings in capital requirements that don't have any particular relationship to changing\\nrisks at individual firms. In addition, one source of volatility in the tests comes from the fact that\\nbanks are forced to do their capital planning before they get the results of our tests. I will address\\neach of these concerns in turn.\\nIn distinguishing useful from less useful volatility, one option to address the year-over-year\\nvolatility of the tests would be to average the results of the tests from the previous year or years.\\nThis would not affect the overall stringency of the tests but, mathematically, would mean that no\\nsingle year could have an outsized influence on the amount of capital that a bank is required to\\nmaintain. The potential downsides to this approach include the reduced risk sensitivity that a\\nbank may experience to a particular test and potential technical challenges associated with\\nchanges to a bank's balance sheet and earnings. Bearing in mind these potential challenges, I\\nbelieve more thinking and discussion of this issue would be fruitful.\\nWith respect to the second concern, as I have said before, I believe it more rational and logical\\nfor firms to be able to plan for their capital needs with the benefit of the results of our tests. Given\\nthe huge strides that the banks have made in their capital planning and in meeting our\\nexpectations, I view the risk of banks backsliding in this regard to be minimal because it would be\\nevident in the next test. Our capital-planning expectations will not decline, and we will continue to\\nuse the supervisory process to enforce these expectations. It is my hope that greater\\ntransparency can play a role in other parts of our supervisory process-for example, by allowing\\nother aspects of bank supervision to benefit from public input. Greater transparency for\\nsupervision is in keeping with one of the biggest improvements to the regulatory framework and\\nto stress testing since the financial crisis. I believe the changes and proposed changes to stress\\ntesting that I have discussed today reinforce the founding principles of the first test, administered\\nin the challenging and uncertain spring of 2009, and reflect what we have learned each year over\\nthe decade since then. That process of learning and refining should and must continue in order\\nto keep stress tests as relevant and effective as they have been in helping to reduce the chances\\nof another severe crisis.\\nbanking firms' assets,\\\" Journal of Financial Economics 71, no.3 (2004): 419-60.\",\n          \"Daniel K Tarullo: Regulating large foreign banking organizations\\nSpeech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\\nSystem, at the Harvard Law School Symposium on \\\"Building the Financial System of the\\nTwenty-first Century: An Agenda for Europe and the United States\\\", Armonk, New York,\\n27 March 2014.\\n* * *\\nThe financial crisis exposed, in painful and dramatic fashion, the shortcomings of existing\\nregulatory and supervisory regimes. In both the United States and the European Union (EU),\\nthe crisis also revealed some particular vulnerabilities created by foreign banking operations.\\nThis evening I would like to focus on these vulnerabilities and on how best we should\\naddress them.\\nLet me note at the outset the now commonplace observation that we have a quite integrated\\ninternational financial system, with many large, globally active firms operating within a\\nsystem of national government and regulation or, in the case of the EU, a hybrid of regional\\nand national regulation. I add the equally commonplace observation that there is no realistic\\nprospect for having a global banking regulator and, consequently, the responsibility and\\nauthority for financial stability will continue to rest with national or regional authorities.1 The\\nquestion, then, is how responsibility for oversight of these large firms can be most effectively\\nshared among regulators. This, of course, is the important issue underlying the perennial\\nchallenge of home-host supervisory relations.\\nAnother introductory observation is that - at least in a world of nations with substantially\\ndifferent economic circumstances, different currencies, and banking and capital markets of\\nquite different levels of depth and development - there will be good reason to vary at least\\nsome forms of regulation across countries. Presumptively, at least, nations should be able to\\nadjust their regulatory systems based on local circumstances and their relative level of risk\\naversion as it pertains to the potential for financial instability. Although the financial systems\\nand economies of the United States and the EU are more similar to one another than they\\nare to those of many other jurisdictions, they are hardly identical. Even between these two,\\nfor example, there may be legitimate differences within the broader convergence around\\nminimum regulatory and supervisory standards developed at the Basel Committee, the\\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions, the Financial Stability Board, and\\nother forums.\\nThese opening observations are important in responding to the curious charge of\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" that has been levelled at the United States and, to a lesser extent, some\\nother jurisdictions, as a result of actions taken or proposed in response to problems\\npresented by foreign banks during the crisis. I say \\\"curious\\\" for several reasons. One is that\\nthe charge reflects a misunderstanding of the allocation of responsibility between home and\\nhost supervisors that has evolved in the Basel Committee during the past several decades.\\nAnother is that the charge seems implicitly, and oddly, premised on the notion that what we\\nhad in 2007 was a well-functioning, integrated global financial system with effective\\nconsolidated supervision of global banks. A third is that the charge overlooks the fact that\\nmuch of what the United States is now doing is matching what the EU has quite sensibly\\nbeen doing for years.\\nIn the rest of my remarks I will elaborate on these points, though not in the spirit of a\\ndebater's arguments, but in an effort to answer the question I posed a moment ago: How,\\nthat is, can we successfully reduce the risks to financial stability posed by large,\\ninternationally active banks? As I hope will become apparent, a theme I wish to emphasize is\\nthat we need to redouble efforts at genuine supervisory cooperation if we are to manage\\neffectively the vulnerabilities and challenges posed by the perennial home-host issue.\\nInternational principles on home- and host-country responsibilities\\nWhile the circumstances and risks may have changed, the issue of the appropriate roles of\\nhome and host countries is not a new one. Indeed, it was a key motivation for creation of the\\nBasel Committee in 1975 following the failures of the Herstatt and Franklin National banks.\\nMany of the Basel Committee's early activities were focused on the challenges created by\\ngaps in the supervision of internationally active banks, as evidenced by the fact that Basel\\n\\\"Concordats\\\" on supervision preceded Basel \\\"Accords\\\" and \\\"Frameworks\\\" on capital and\\nother subjects. This task has, of necessity, been ongoing, as experience revealed gaps in\\nsupervisory coverage and as the scale and scope of internationally active banks grew. The\\nprinciple of consolidated supervision emerged in the early 1980s to ensure that some specific\\nbanking authority - generally the home-country regulator - had a complete view of the\\nassets and liabilities of the bank.2 This principle was reinforced and elaborated following the\\nBank of Credit and Commerce International episode in the early 1990s.3\\nIt is important to note that each Basel Committee declaration on the importance of\\nhomecountry consolidated oversight has also included a statement of the obligations and\\nprerogatives of host states in which significant foreign bank operations are located. This\\nfeature of the Basel Committee's approach makes sense as a reflection both of the host\\nauthority's responsibility for stability of its financial system and of the practical point that a\\nhost authority will be more familiar with the characteristics and risks in its market. In\\naccordance with this history, the current version of the \\\"Core Principles for Effective Banking\\nSupervision\\\" sets out as one of its \\\"essential criteria\\\" for home-host relationships that \\\"[t]he\\nhost supervisor's national laws or regulations require that the cross-border operations of\\nforeign banks are subject to prudential, inspection and regulatory reporting requirements\\nsimilar to those for domestic banks.\\\"4\\nIt is clear, then, that consolidated supervision is not intended to displace host-country\\nsupervision. Instead, as the Basel Committee has regularly noted, the two are intended to be\\ncomplementary, so as to assure effective oversight of large, internationally active banks.\\nSimilarly, the stated purpose of the Basel Committee in requiring consolidated capital\\nrequirements is not to remove from host countries any responsibility or discretion to apply\\nregulatory capital requirements, but to \\\"preserve the integrity of capital in banks with\\nsubsidiaries by eliminating double gearing.\\\"5 Likewise, and contrary to suggestions that are\\nsometimes made, the capital accords and frameworks developed by the Basel Committee\\nhave always been explicitly minimum requirements. They are floors, not ceilings.\\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in establishing a post-crisis framework for domestic\\nsystemically important banks (D-SIBs), the Basel Committee made clear that a host country\\nmay in appropriate circumstances designate domestic operations of a foreign bank as\\nsystemically important for that country, even if the parent foreign bank has already been\\ndesignated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).6 The idea informing the newly\\ncreated concept of a D-SIB is that an entity whose stress or failure could destabilize a\\ndomestic financial system might thereby indirectly destabilize the international financial\\nsystem. Thus, the D-SIB category carries along with it higher loss-absorbency requirements\\nthan are generally applicable to domestic banks, although perhaps not as high as\\nrequirements for G-SIBs. Of course, our regulation for foreign banking organizations (FBOs)\\ndoes not entail D-SIB designation or require higher than generally applicable loss\\nabsorbency. But I cite this feature of the D-SIB framework that permits designation of the\\ndomestic operations of foreign G-SIBs because it reflects rather clearly the principle that the\\nspecific characteristics of domestic markets may call for regulation of foreign banks in the\\nhost country, not just at a consolidated level.\\nIn short, the work of the Basel Committee over the years has not been directed at restraining\\nhost-country authorities from supervising and regulating foreign banking operations in their\\ncountry. On the contrary, the committee has repeatedly asserted the complementary\\nresponsibilities of both home and host countries to oversee large, internationally active\\nbanking groups, in the interests of both national and international financial stability. And the\\ncommittee has frequently returned to this set of issues in responding to developments that\\npose a threat to the safety and soundness of the international financial system.\\nThe shift in foreign bank activities\\nUnfortunately, neither the Basel Committee nor national regulators responded in a timely\\nfashion to the magnitude of the expansion in scale and scope of the world's largest banking\\norganizations in the roughly 15 years before the financial crisis. As illustrated in figure 1, at\\nthe end of 1974, just before the Basel Committee was created, the assets of the world's\\n10 largest banking organizations together equaled about 8 percent of global GDP. The three\\nlargest were all American - BankAmerica, Citicorp, and Chase Manhattan. But their\\ncombined assets were equal to less than 3-1/2 percent of world GDP and, as illustrated in\\nfigure 2, about 10 percent of the GDP of their home country, the United States. By 1988 the\\ncombined assets of the world's 10 largest banking organizations as a proportion of world\\nGDP had nearly doubled to about 15 percent, a ratio that held constant during the\\nsucceeding decade, at the beginning of the emerging market financial crisis in 1997.\\nThen the explosive growth began. In the next decade - that is, up to the onset of the financial\\ncrisis in 2007 - the combined assets of the world's 10 largest banks as a share of global\\nGDP nearly tripled, to about 43 percent. The largest bank in the world at that time, Royal\\nBank of Scotland (RBS), had assets equivalent to about 6.8 percent of global GDP, nearly\\ntwice the comparable figure for the three largest banks combined in 1974. Adding the assets\\nof Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas - the second and third largest banks in 2007 - to those\\nof RBS, the three had combined assets equal to about 17 percent of global GDP. And each\\nof the three had assets nearly equal to, or in one instance substantially more than, the GDP\\nof its home country. Even the eighth-ranked bank, UBS, had assets well over four times the\\nGDP of its home country, Switzerland.\\nNot only did the size of the largest banks change dramatically, so, too, did their scope,\\nreflecting the overall integration of capital market and traditional lending activities that\\naccelerated in the decade and a half preceding the crisis. This trend was particularly\\napparent in the United States and the United Kingdom, homes to the world's two largest\\nfinancial centers. In the United States, the proportion of foreign banking assets to total U.S.\\nbanking assets has remained constant at approximately one-fifth since the late 1990s. But\\nthe concentration and character of those assets have changed noticeably. Today there are\\nas many foreign as U.S.-owned banks with at least $50 billion in U.S. assets, the threshold\\nestablished by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for banks\\nfor which more stringent prudential measures must be established.7 Perhaps even more\\nimportant was the shift in composition of foreign bank assets in the 15 years before the crisis,\\nwith the proportion of assets held in the U.S. broker-dealers of the 10 largest FBOs rising\\nfrom approximately 15 percent to roughly 50 percent.8 Today, 4 of the top 10 broker-dealers\\nin the United States, and 12 of the top 20, are owned by foreign banks.\\nMeanwhile, even the traditional branching model of large foreign commercial banks in the\\nUnited States had changed. Reliance on less stable, short-term wholesale funding increased\\nsignificantly. Many foreign banks shifted from the \\\"lending branch\\\" model to a \\\"funding\\nbranch\\\" model, in which U.S. branches of foreign banks were borrowing large amounts of\\nU.S. dollars to upstream to their parents. These \\\"funding branches\\\" went from holding\\n40 percent of foreign bank branch assets in the mid-1990s to holding 75 percent of foreign\\nbank branch assets by 2009. Foreign banks as a group moved from a position of receiving\\nfunding from their parents on a net basis in 1999 to providing significant funding to non-U.S.\\naffiliates by the mid-2000s - more than $600 billion on a net basis by 2008.9\\nA good bit of this short-term funding was used to finance long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated\\nproject and trade finance around the world. There is also evidence that a significant portion\\nof the dollars raised by European banks in the pre-crisis period ultimately returned to the\\nUnited States in the form of investments in U.S. securities. Indeed, the amount of U.S.\\ndollardenominated asset-backed securities and other securities held by Europeans increased\\nsignificantly between 2003 and 2007, much of it financed by the short-term,\\ndollardenominated liabilities of European banks.10\\nJust as regulatory systems did not, in the years preceding the crisis, address vulnerabilities\\nsuch as reliance on short-term wholesale funding that were created by the integration of\\ncapital markets and traditional lending, so they did not respond to the transformation of\\nforeign banking operations. Accordingly, just as home countries of systemically important\\nbanks have been playing catch-up on capital, liquidity, and other requirements, so host\\ncountries of very large foreign banking operations are playing catch-up in dealing with the\\nvery different character of many internationally active banks from that of 20 or 30 years ago.\\nThe regulatory response\\nIn a sense, the major strengthening during the past few years of capital and liquidity\\nrequirements for internationally active banks - including the capital surcharge for banks of\\nglobal systemic importance - has to date been the most important international regulatory\\nresponse to the revealed vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations.\\nBuilding capital and improving the liquidity positions of banks on a consolidated basis is\\nsurely a key step toward assuring the stability of major FBOs in host countries.\\nOf course, these agreed changes have not yet been fully implemented. It is critical not just\\nthat all jurisdictions adopt appropriate regulations that fully incorporate the new Basel\\nstandards, but also that we ensure our banks will be substantively, and not just formally,\\ncompliant as the various transition target dates are reached. It is also the case that there is\\nmore to be done in addressing the risks posed by large global banking organizations,\\nincluding additional measures to deal with the run risks associated with short-term wholesale\\nfunding and ensuring that even the largest firms can be successfully resolved without either\\ncreating major systemic problems or requiring an infusion of public capital. I will return to\\nthese subjects a bit later, in discussing the cooperative agenda that lies ahead for the United\\nStates, Europe, and our partners throughout the world.\\nFirst, though, I want to describe how Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States are\\ndealing with the vulnerabilities associated with large foreign banking operations, and thus are\\nfulfilling their responsibilities as host-country supervisors. I discuss the United Kingdom\\nseparately from the EU both because it is outside the euro zone and because, as a host\\njurisdiction, it is more similar to the United States than to other EU member states or, indeed,\\nto any other country in the world.\\nThe EU has not, since the crisis, specifically adjusted the structure of regulation of foreign\\nbanks by its member states in their role as host supervisors. For more than a decade before\\nthe crisis, EU member states had prudently required that not only commercial banking, but\\nalso investment banking subsidiaries of foreign (non-EU-based) banking organizations, be\\nsubject to Basel capital requirements in the same way as EU-based firms. With the adoption\\nof CRD IV,11 the directive implementing the new EU capital requirements, Basel III will now\\nbe applied to all EU firms, including EU bank and investment bank subsidiaries of non-EU\\nbanking organizations. Branches of non-EU banks are generally not subject to local\\nrequirements.\\nBefore the crisis and the subsequent development of Basel III, there was no leverage ratio\\nrequirement in EU capital directives. Insofar as a new leverage ratio is part of the Basel III\\npackage agreed upon internationally, one would anticipate that it will be applied to\\ncommercial banking and investment banking firms in the EU, again including local\\nsubsidiaries of non-EU firms. Likewise, one would anticipate that the Basel III liquidity\\nrequirements will be implemented in the EU in accordance with the internationally agreed\\ntimeline and, again, that it will apply to EU subsidiaries of FBOs.\\nA greater challenge for the EU has been dealing with banks headquartered in one EU\\ncountry but doing business in other EU countries under the \\\"single passport,\\\" which basically\\nallows for full access in the rest of the EU, with supervision provided only by the home\\ncountry. During the crisis, there were some notable instances of banking stresses and\\nfailures involving such institutions, with consequent negative effects on depositors,\\ncounterparties, and economies in other parts of the EU. Much of the ongoing post-crisis\\nreform agenda in Europe seems directed at ensuring the safety and soundness of EU-based\\ninstitutions. The most important of these changes may be the assumption by the European\\nCentral Bank of supervisory responsibility for larger euro area banks. And, as we saw just\\nlast week, work continues on the long process of creating a credible resolution mechanism\\nfor those banks.\\nAs a member state of the EU, the United Kingdom of course implements the EU policies I\\nhave just described. But that country has applied an additional set of requirements on the\\nlocal operations of foreign banks, particularly with respect to liquidity. The Prudential\\nRegulation Authority of the Bank of England applies local liquidity requirements to\\ncommercial and investment banking subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks, requiring them to hold\\nlocal buffers as determined by internal stress tests with both 14- and 90-day components.\\nThe assumptions on which the stress tests are premised are quite strict. For example, the\\nU.K. subsidiary generally must assume zero inflows from non-U.K. affiliates - even for claims\\non non-U.K. affiliates with short terms that mature within the stress test period - and\\n100 percent outflows to non-U.K. affiliates. The requirements generated by the test are\\nsubject to a supervisory review and add-on that for some firms has resulted in a significant\\nincrease in the buffer requirement. Branches of foreign commercial banks may in some\\ncircumstances be subject to local liquidity requirements as well.\\nThe U.K. initiative in applying local liquidity requirements is wholly understandable in light of\\nthe difficulties encountered because of stress on foreign institutions, including the Lehman\\nbankruptcy, during the crisis. Because London is one of the world's two largest financial\\ncenter hosts, the United Kingdom is the only country other than the United States hosting\\nnumerous, very large broker-dealers that are owned by foreign banks and also a broad array\\nof commercial bank subsidiaries and branches that are owned by foreign banks. In fact, the\\nsix institutions headquartered outside the United States and the United Kingdom that are in\\nthe top three tiers of G-SIBs hold roughly 40 percent of their worldwide assets in those two\\njurisdictions.12 Thus the U.K. initiative on liquidity and its internal debates on matters such as\\nstructural supervision, the Vickers proposals, and stress testing have all been very instructive\\nfor the Federal Reserve Board. Even where we have eventually adopted somewhat different\\napproaches, we respect the motivation and scrupulousness of the U.K. banking authorities in\\naddressing the systemic vulnerabilities posed by FBOs and in fulfilling their responsibility to\\nthe rest of the world to assure the stability of one of the world's two most important financial\\ncenters.\\nUnlike the EU, the United States did not - prior to the financial crisis - require that all\\nbrokerdealers and investment banks meet Basel capital standards. The legacy of the\\nGlassSteagall Act, which had separated investment banking from commercial banking, meant that\\nonly commercial banks were subject to the prudential regulation of the federal banking\\nagencies. In Europe, the dominance of universal banking, or variants thereon, led more\\nnaturally to application of capital and other prudential standards to all forms of banking\\nactivity. Even after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act removed the remaining barriers to affiliation\\nbetween investment banks and commercial banks in the United States, Basel capital\\nrequirements applied at a consolidated level to the activities of an investment bank or\\nbrokerdealer only if it did affiliate with a commercial bank. Thus, the five large \\\"free-standing\\\" U.S.\\ninvestment banks were generally not subject to full application of Basel capital standards.\\nDuring the crisis, the ill-advised nature of this regulatory state of affairs became apparent.\\nThe decline in value of many mortgage-backed securities and the consequent market\\nuncertainty as to the true value of that entire class of securities raised questions about the\\nsolvency of major broker-dealers. Because the dealers were so highly leveraged and\\ndependent on short-term financing, the uncertainty also led to serious liquidity strains, first at\\nBear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and eventually at most dealers - domestic and foreign\\nowned. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were acquired by existing bank holding companies\\nafter coming close to failure. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Goldman Sachs and Morgan\\nStanley became bank holding companies.\\nThrough its Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Federal Reserve provided substantial liquidity\\nto the broker-dealer affiliates of the bank holding companies, as well as to the primary dealer\\nsubsidiaries of foreign banks. At the same time, the shift in strategy of many foreign banks\\ntoward using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around the\\nworld created another set of vulnerabilities that resulted in substantial and, relative to total\\nassets, disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve's discount window by foreign bank\\nbranches.\\nThe experience of the crisis made clear, first, that the perimeter of prudential regulation\\naround U.S. financial institutions needed to be expanded. As noted a moment ago, this had\\noccurred de facto during the crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act has given a legal foundation for this\\nchange, first by mandating that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will remain subject to\\nconsolidated prudential regulation even were they to divest their insured depository\\ninstitutions and, second, by giving the Financial Stability Oversight Council the authority to\\ndesignate other financial firms as systemically important, a step that would place them under\\nFederal Reserve regulation and supervision. Dodd-Frank further required the Federal\\nReserve to apply progressively more stringent prudential regulation to bank holding\\ncompanies with more than $50 billion in assets.\\nCongress also required the Federal Reserve to apply special prudential standards to large\\nFBOs. As I have already implied, much of what we have done is simply to catch up to EU\\nand U.K. practice. Under our recently finalized Section 165 enhanced prudential standards\\nregulation, an FBO with U.S. non-branch assets of $50 billion or more must hold its U.S.\\nsubsidiaries under an intermediate holding company (IHC), which must meet the risk-based\\nand leverage capital standards generally applicable to bank holding companies under U.S.\\nlaw.13 Such an FBO must also certify that it meets consolidated capital adequacy standards\\nestablished by its home-country supervisor that are consistent with the Basel Capital\\nFramework. FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must also meet liquidity\\nrisk-management standards and conduct internal liquidity stress tests. The IHC must\\nmaintain a liquidity buffer in the United States for a 30-day liquidity stress test. The U.S.\\nbranches and agencies of an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal\\nto the liquidity needs for 14 days, as determined by a 30-day liquidity stress test.14 The IHCs\\nof FBOs must also conform to certain risk-management and supervisory requirements at the\\nIHC level.\\nStructurally, the U.S. capital requirements for FBOs are similar to those that apply to foreign\\nbanks in the EU. That is, generally applicable Basel capital requirements are applied to the\\nU.S. operations of FBOs that own local banking subsidiaries, investment banks, and\\nbrokerdealers. In fact, the new U.S. rules are somewhat more favorable to foreign institutions, in\\nthat they only apply once the non-branch U.S. assets of an FBO exceed $50 billion. That\\ndollar amount, incidentally, is the same as the Dodd-Frank threshold for more stringent\\nprudential measures, though note that this statutory threshold applies if the total assets of\\nany U.S. banking organization - foreign, as well as domestic - exceed that level. As in the\\nEU, the capital requirements do not apply to U.S. branches of foreign banks, even though the\\ncrisis experience provides some credible arguments for doing so.\\nThe leverage ratio requirement has received particular attention. One complaint is that the\\nforeign operations of U.S. banks are not subject to leverage ratios for their local operations. It\\nis true that many foreign countries - including the EU member states - do not currently have\\nleverage ratio standards for their banks. As noted earlier, however, one may reasonably\\nexpect that those countries will be implementing the Basel III leverage ratio in a timely\\nfashion. Also, I would note in passing that the U.S. leverage ratio requirement for foreign\\nfirms will be phased in more slowly than originally proposed, so as to align it more closely\\nwith the effective date of the Basel III leverage ratio requirement.\\nA second complaint is that there is something unfair about the United States requiring an\\nFBO to meet the international leverage ratio in its U.S. operations, because its operations\\nmay be heavily weighted toward broker-dealer activities, which generally have higher\\nleverage, whereas the leverage ratio for U.S. firms is based on their global operations. Again,\\none suspects that the foreign operations of U.S. firms could be subject to a similar ratio\\nrequirement abroad as countries implement their Basel III commitments. However, quite\\napart from what may happen in the future, there are two U.S.-based firms - Goldman Sachs\\nand Morgan Stanley - whose global business mix resembles that of the U.S. subsidiaries of\\nFBOs that are predominantly engaged in broker-dealer activities in the United States. In fact,\\nunder the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio the Board proposed during the summer,\\nthese and other U.S. G-SIBs would be subject to a higher Basel III leverage ratio\\nrequirement (5 percent) than would apply to FBO IHCs (3 percent).\\nThe applicable liquidity requirements, while somewhat differently defined, are roughly\\ncomparable to those already applicable to FBOs in the United Kingdom. The similar positions\\nof our two nations as host countries for foreign bank operations heavily involved in trading\\nand significantly reliant on potentially runnable short-term wholesale funding explain this\\nrough parallelism.\\nThe most notable departure of the new U.S. FBO standards from existing EU and U.K.\\npractice lies in the IHC requirement for foreign banks with large domestic operations. Given\\nthe structure of U.S. financial regulation that is a legacy of Glass-Steagall, as well as the\\nefforts by a small number of very large foreign banks to evade the intent of Congress that\\ncapital standards apply to their U.S. operations, we needed to create this structural\\nrequirement. It is unclear how much difference this makes for the capital requirements of\\nFBOs in the United States as opposed, say, to those of U.S. operations in the EU. That\\nwould depend on the existence and size of financial affiliates owned by the U.S. firm that are\\nnot subject to Basel standards directly. In any case, it seems sound prudential practice - and\\nconsistent with the various Basel Committee principles to which I earlier referred - that large\\ndomestic operations of foreign banks meet capital standards on the basis of all exposures in\\nthe host jurisdiction and, indeed, that they manage their risks in that country across all their\\naffiliates.\\n\\\"Balkanization\\\" and home-host responsibilities\\nTo return to the issue of Balkanization, three things should now be apparent. First, in its new\\ncapital regulations applicable to FBOs, the United States is more a follower of the pattern set\\nby the EU than it is an initiator of new kinds of requirements. Of course, a few foreign banks\\nwould prefer the old system under which they held relatively little capital in their very\\nextensive U.S. operations. But that was neither safe for the financial system nor particularly\\nfair to their competitors - U.S. and foreign - that hold significant amounts of capital here.\\nIndeed, a firm that is genuinely well capitalized, including holding the G-SIB surcharge at its\\nglobal consolidated level, should require only moderate adjustment efforts during the\\ntransition period established in the FBO rule.\\nSecond, there is considerable scope for a foreign bank to integrate its U.S. operations with\\nits global activities within the rule the Federal Reserve adopted last month. For example,\\nwhile foreign firms with more than $10 billion in non-branch assets have some additional\\nreporting requirements, only when U.S. non-branch assets rise above $50 billion do the\\nquantitative Basel capital requirements become applicable to the U.S. subsidiaries.\\nMoreover, no capital requirements apply to branches so long as their parent is subject to\\nhome-country consolidated capital rules consistent with Basel standards. The U.S.\\noperations of FBO branches and subsidiaries will not be subject to \\\"due from\\\" restrictions.\\nThey remain free to lend money to their worldwide affiliates; they must simply do so with a\\nmore stable funding base. Finally, I note that many FBOs, like many U.S.-based banks, have\\nmade considerable progress in reducing dependence on short-term wholesale funding and in\\nbuilding capital. To some extent, the new requirements are intended to preserve this\\nprogress.\\nThird, the capital and liquidity requirements that do apply are wholly consistent with the\\nresponsibility of host-country supervisors to assure financial stability in their own markets.\\nCollectively, foreign banks with a large presence in the United States conduct activities of a\\nscope, and at a scale, that could lead to problems for the U.S. financial system should they\\ncome under stress. Realistically, exposures and vulnerabilities in a large host-country market\\nare much more difficult for home-country supervisors to assess. Indeed, U.S. regulators\\ncount on the expertise and proximity of U.K. regulators in overseeing the London operations\\nof large U.S. financial institutions to enhance the effective consolidated supervision and\\nregulation for which we are responsible.\\nOn the issue of home-host-country coordination in regulating large, globally active banking\\norganizations, I would make three additional points. First, our FBO capital requirements, like\\nthose of the EU for foreign commercial and investment banks, are based on the capital rules\\nagreed to in the Basel Committee.15 Thus, there is an overall compatibility between national\\nand international rules with respect to applicable definitions, standards, and required ratios.\\nSecond, home countries must implement and enforce faithfully at a consolidated level these\\nsame capital rules. More broadly, home-country supervisory expectations for strong\\nconsolidated capital levels, liquidity positions, and risk-management practices are likely to\\nfacilitate compliance with domestic requirements for large FBOs of the sort applicable in the\\nUnited States and the EU. It is also important that home countries assure the credibility of\\nresolution mechanisms for their large banking organizations. This task entails the\\nimplementation of the Financial Stability Board's principles for effective resolution regimes,\\nincluding establishing a resolution authority with adequate legal powers to manage the\\nprocess in an orderly fashion without injection of public capital.16 It also includes requiring\\neach such institution to have total loss absorption capacity sufficient to recapitalize the firm\\neven if its substantial equity buffer is lost in an extreme tail event. Home and host countries\\nshould work together toward international standards that will ensure that an appropriate\\namount of this capacity would be available to host authorities faced with the potential\\ninsolvency of large FBOs in their jurisdiction or with the consequences for their market of the\\nfailure of parent banks.\\nIn this regard, I think that capital requirements for FBOs of the sort now required by the EU\\nand the United States are very likely to reduce the considerable strains that have traditionally\\naccompanied financial distress at global banking firms. In most cases, including both\\ninternationally and within the EU itself in recent years, stress has resulted in the demand by\\nhost authorities for ex post ring fencing of capital, liquidity, or both, often in the absence of\\nany ex ante requirements. The existence of FBO capital and liquidity standards, particularly if\\nsupplemented with the total loss absorbency measures to which I just referred, should\\nmitigate the need for such demands, which of course come at the worst possible time for the\\nfirm trying to meet them.\\nThird, we - by which I mean both home and major host banking regulators - need to find\\nbetter ways of fostering genuine regulatory and supervisory cooperation. Particularly at the\\nmost senior levels of the agencies that actually supervise globally active banks, our\\ninteractions with our counterparts from other countries have become almost exclusively\\nfocused on developing international standards or reviewing compliance with existing ones.\\nThese discussions are usually conducted with numerous colleagues who are not themselves\\nresponsible for banking regulation in their own jurisdictions. As important as these efforts\\nhave been, and continue to be, following the crisis, there is a risk that by not having\\nopportunities for senior officials of the various national agencies that have direct supervisory\\nresponsibility for banking organizations to meet and discuss shared challenges, we give\\nshort shrift to the collective interest of bank regulators in effective supervision of all globally\\nactive firms. Proposals to include prudential requirements or, more precisely, to include\\nlimitations on prudential requirements in trade agreements would lead us farther away from\\nthe aforementioned goal of emphasizing shared financial stability interests, in favor of an\\napproach to prudential matters informed principally by considerations of commercial\\nadvantage.\\nConclusion\\nThe job of regulating and supervising large, globally active banking organizations is a tough\\none. Issues of moral hazard, negative externalities, and asymmetric information are, if not\\npervasive, then at least significant and recurring. The job is made only harder by the fact that\\nthese firms cross borders in ways their regulators do not. But we cannot ignore this fact and\\npretend that we have global oversight. International standards for prudential regulation are\\nnot the same as global regulations, and consolidated supervision is not the same as\\ncomprehensive supervision. The jurisdictions represented on the Basel Committee not only\\nhave the right to regulate their financial markets - including large FBOs participating in those\\nmarkets - they have a responsibility to their home jurisdictions, and to the rest of the world,\\nto do so. The most important contribution the United States can make to global financial\\nstability is to ensure the stability of our own financial system.\\nThere must be some assurance beyond mere words from parent banks or home-country\\nsupervisors that a large FBO will remain strong or supported in periods of stress. After all, as\\nwe saw in the crisis, while a parent bank or home-country authorities may have offered those\\nwords with total good faith in calm times, they may be unable to carry through on them in\\nmore financially turbulent periods. None of this means that we need be at odds with one\\nanother. On the contrary, these very circumstances call not only for more tangible\\nsafeguards in host countries, but also for more genuine cooperation among supervisory\\nauthorities. Indeed, as I hope will continue to be the case with the international agenda on\\nresolution, total loss absorbency, and related matters, we should aspire to converge around\\nthe kinds of protections that we can expect at both consolidated and local levels.\\nBIS central bankers' speeches 11\",\n          \"William C Dudley: The national and regional economic outlook\\nRemarks by Mr William C Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal\\nReserve Bank of New York, at the University at Albany, Albany, New York, 18 November 2011.\\n* * *\\nGood morning. I am pleased to be at the University at Albany. It is always a pleasure to\\nspeak with students and faculty because of the intellectual leadership role you play in your\\ncommunities. I also welcome the addition of business leaders to this gathering because you\\nshape the economic landscape in the region. So, I thank you all for coming today and helping\\nmake this such a rich audience.\\nOver the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across\\nmy Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to\\nWashington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international\\nbank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure\\nthat my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As\\nyou may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in\\nnorthern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\nIn August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark,\\nPatterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and\\nPuerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\\nMy trip started yesterday with a policy speech to the West Point cadets and was followed by\\na colloquium with their economics faculty. So, this visit to the upper Hudson Valley brings me\\nin contact with some of our country's future leaders - you and the cadets who will lead our\\ncountry in very important, if different, ways.\\nI will also have a chance to see more of what makes Albany so distinct from both downstate\\nand Upstate New York. Of course, I may have a leg up on this because I was born and\\nraised close by, in western Massachusetts!\\nThe greater Albany area is home to 900,000 people - roughly the size of three average cities\\nin the United States. You and your fellow residents tend to be highly educated and be\\nemployed as public servants. These factors are all part of what makes Albany feel special.\\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed - what we do and why we do it. Then I'll\\ngive you my views on the economy nationally and locally. It's a serious issue because it\\naffects your family and students' job prospects at graduation time.\\nWhat the New York Fed does\\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my\\njob so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily\\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as\\nthe FOMC.\\nI am vice chair of the FOMC - a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in\\nWashington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The\\nmembers of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by\\nCongress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.\\nSometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should\\nview this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions - particularly at times like this -\\nand we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are\\nunited in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential\\nto the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term\\npolitical pressures.\\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region\\nand the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical\\ninformation that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils\\nand community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. This trip includes\\nmeetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global Foundries (an advanced\\nmicroprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic Development Council, and the\\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a\\nnumber of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of\\neconomic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are\\nessentially local measures of output - similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the\\nnational level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the\\nemployment report, which is the only other available metric at the state level. We have also\\nstarted a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount\\nand type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a\\ntimely way.\\nIn addition, we have a new poll about credit and financing for small businesses, the latter are\\nan important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and\\nreasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011\\npoll, of which nearly 15 percent were from the upstate region. The next poll will be in\\nJanuary. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll,\\nplease pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\\nNext month, we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses\\n- to provide information about how they can participate in the global economy and expand\\ntheir companies by exporting their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small\\nBusiness Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce will be on hand. They will\\ntell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government\\nprograms are available to enhance credit, reduce payment risk and increase lines of working\\ncapital. We are also facilitating a \\\"speed mentoring\\\" forum in which small businesses will\\nreceive feedback on their business plans and advice about applying for financing from a\\nrange of finance professionals.\\nIn 2012, we're planning similar events in the capital region. We hope to partner with many of\\nyou to support the small business sector.\\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we\\ntarget some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked\\nhard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we\\nhave provided housing advocates, including the Empire Justice Center, with the latest\\ninformation on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters.\\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit\\nnewyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business,\\ncredit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our\\ncolleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial\\nsystem on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at\\nit. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual - whether on\\nthe part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\\nNational economic conditions\\nNow, let me update you on national economic conditions.\\nWe stand here today several years after the worst financial crisis in modern times. The\\norigins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had\\ngrown to great size during the middle part of the last decade.\\nPrior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and imbalanced\\nglobal economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide. This was particularly\\nextreme in certain markets such as U.S. housing and housing finance.\\nThis mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive build-up of debt\\nin many parts of the global economy. Many - though not all - U.S. households responded to\\nthe easy availability of credit and rising home prices by taking on more debt. When the\\nhousing boom lost steam and began to burst, expectations about housing prices and wealth\\nwere disappointed. The bursting of the credit bubble also created instability within the global\\nfinancial system and, this, in turn resulted in a sharp drop in the credit available to\\nhouseholds and businesses.\\nThe result was what is now called the \\\"Great Recession\\\". Over the period from late 2007\\nthrough mid-2009, real GDP declined by more than 5 percent, making this recession the\\nlongest and deepest recession of the postwar period.\\nThe recession was felt in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe impact it\\nhad on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the recession, contributing to a\\nsharp rise in the unemployment rate from around 4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over\\n10 percent in October 2009.\\nExtraordinary actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve,\\nprevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy stabilized\\naround mid-2009. But since then the recovery has been bifurcated. While emerging\\neconomies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown only slowly. This has\\nhastened a historic shift in the balance of economic power that was already underway before\\nthe crisis.\\nIn the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than expected.\\nGrowth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment significantly or to achieve a\\nself-reinforcing cycle of strengthening confidence, demand, income and employment.\\nAlthough the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from\\nearlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very weak first half,\\nwhen GDP growth was less than 1 percent, economic activity has strengthened somewhat\\nand inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated\\nto be 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be\\nsomewhat higher. This modest rebound reflects in part the passing of transitory factors such\\nas the damping effect on household and business spending power from rises in energy and\\nfood prices as well as the supply disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\\nHowever, as we look toward 2012, the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to\\na robust recovery. Accordingly I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012.\\nConsumer price inflation has begun to moderate. This moderation is just starting to become\\nevident on a 12-month time horizon - in which consumer price inflation as measured by the\\nconsumer price index (CPI) is rising at about a 3.5 percent annual rate. Given current\\nexpectations for the path of energy prices - taken from futures markets - consumer price\\ninflation on a year-over-year basis should continue to fall over the next few months.\\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few\\nyears. The economy is operating far below its productive potential - leaving the level of\\noutput, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy's unused\\nresources were put to work. One summary statistic says it all - the unemployment rate is\\nunacceptably high at 9 percent. Given my outlook, the decline of unemployment over the\\nnext year is likely to be modest. Furthermore, we also continue to face significant downside\\nrisks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\\nIn a speech yesterday at West Point, I highlighted the need for our nation to deploy a full set\\nof economic policy tools to secure the recovery and build for the long term. This includes\\nmonetary policy, but also requires policies to help repair housing markets, fiscal policy that\\nsupports growth in the short and long run, and structural reforms that increase\\ncompetitiveness and support a shift in the pattern of economic activity toward a more\\nsustainable growth path than that which prevailed during the last business cycle upswing.\\nRegional economic conditions\\nHow is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York\\nFed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor conditions in New York State.1\\nBased on our index, the downturn in the state's economy ended in November of 2009. Since\\nthen, I would describe the state's economy as recovering at a moderate pace, although there\\nappears to have been a pause in September.\\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to learn about\\nconditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that November's report (issued\\nthis Tuesday) shows signs of stabilizing after five months of weakening. In November, more\\nmanufacturers are adopting an optimistic outlook.\\nLike many other large states, New York has a bifurcated economy. New York's downstate\\narea differs dramatically from the upstate area in terms of industrial composition, occupations\\nand job growth. While Albany may be geographically midway between the two areas, its\\nindustry mix resembles neither the downstate's heavy concentration in the service sector, nor\\nthe upstate focus on the manufacturing sector. What sets Albany apart is that it is home to\\nthe state's capital. About one quarter of employees in the Albany area work for the\\ngovernment - about a third more than the statewide average.\\nThe local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this recession, but\\nthe impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well established. During the downturn,\\nthe capital region saw a loss of about 20,000 jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment,\\nconsiderably less severe than the 6.5 percent nationwide decline. Over the past year and a\\nhalf, job losses have slowed. But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently\\nsay that a solid recovery is underway. The Albany area is not yet consistently adding jobs.\\nThis is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced by New York State. The state\\nhas cut a considerable number of government jobs and reduced other expenditures as part\\nof its effort to close significant budget gaps. These job reductions have disproportionately\\nslowed Albany's local economy.2\\nIn contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany's private sector is showing signs of recovery.\\nYour private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to offset the public\\nsector job losses. However, this job creation has not been robust enough to bring down the\\nunemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent of the workforce. That is a lower rate of\\nunemployment than the national rate, as is usual for Albany. However, it is almost double the\\njobless rate in early 2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended. It will be\\ndifficult for growth in the region's economy to resume and for unemployment to decline until\\nthe public sector stabilizes.\\nAn important plus for the local economy is the capital region's housing sector, which has\\nweathered the economic storm relatively well. As a result, the drop-off in economic activity\\nthat is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not\\nbeen as severe here as it has been in many other places around the country. Like much of\\nUpstate New York, Albany's housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of\\nthe country. During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany's house prices rose by 85 percent,\\nmuch higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate New York as a whole\\nand almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen nationally. Unlike the rest of the\\nnation, though, the region's housing market has been comparatively stable since then. Prices\\nhave declined by about 7 percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of\\n32 percent nationally.\\nNonetheless, declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased\\nfinancial pressures on families. During the recession, all across the nation, high levels of debt\\nled to a soaring number of delinquencies. Many families found that they needed to reduce\\ntheir debt to more sustainable levels.\\nDrawing on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that these\\ntrends have certainly affected people in this area.3 But the good news is that the effects have\\nnot been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country. Households in the Albany\\nregion did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest of the state and\\ncountry during the run-up to the crisis. Recent data indicate that the average adult in Albany\\nhas about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20 percent lower than the average across the\\nstate and country as a whole. Thus, financial strains on many families in the Albany area\\nwere lower than in many other places around the state and nation.\\nHowever, the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the area,\\nso it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures. About 4 percent of debt\\nbalances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany, which is twice the 2 percent delinquency\\nrate in 2005. Although this is less than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this\\ndoubling of delinquencies in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress\\nfor many families here.\\nStepping back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of\\nfundamental strengths. These strengths show through in some key ways:\\n\\uf0b7 Albany is growing. The recent Census shows that the population in the region\\nexpanded by 5.5 percent over the past decade, more than double the statewide\\naverage. Saratoga County saw an especially strong gain of nearly 10 percent.\\n\\uf0b7 Incomes in the region are high. Albany is the state's most affluent area outside the\\nNew York City metropolitan region. Median household income was roughly $57,000\\nin 2009, moderately above the statewide median and well above the nation's. Not\\nsurprisingly, then, the poverty rate is lower than the U.S. average - 11 percent\\nversus 14 percent nationally.\\n\\uf0b7 Your residents are highly educated. Educational attainment - a critically important\\ndriver of economic activity - is also well above the national average. A third of adults\\nwho live in the Albany area hold college degrees.\\nOne of Albany's key strengths is its higher education industry. The colleges and universities\\nin the capital region help stabilize the local economy during downturns and recoveries.\\nIndeed, the private education sector continually added jobs before, during, and after the\\nGreat Recession, both nationally and locally. For example, the University at Albany has\\ntaken a lead role in shaping the next generation of financial professionals and regulators\\nthrough its pioneering curriculums. From my perspective at the Fed, a particularly important\\nand timely example is the University's innovative National Science Foundation-supported\\nprogram for instruction and research in financial market regulation.\\nResearch conducted by the New York Fed has shown that colleges and universities can help\\nbuild the skills and education of their region's workforce, which is critical to an area's ultimate\\neconomic success.4 They do this in two ways. Most directly, colleges and universities support\\nan educated workforce by producing new college graduates, some of whom will stay and\\nwork in the area. The University at Albany clearly plays this role in the capital area.\\nPerhaps equally important in terms of promoting local economic growth, colleges and\\nuniversities can play a key role in creating jobs for skilled workers in local businesses.\\nColleges and universities conduct research and development that can have \\\"spillover effects\\\"\\ninto the local economy. Businesses in the region can take advantage of being close to these\\ninnovative activities and facilities to develop new products and technologies. This can also\\nhelp draw new companies to the region to access university resources. Thus, successful\\nindustry-higher education partnerships can provide a quite a boost for a region's economy.\\nThe local nanotech sector provides an excellent example of this type of partnership at work.\\nDuring my visit to the University's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering this\\nafternoon I look forward to seeing the facilities and hearing more about the Center's plans to\\nlead the way in global nanotech research. More broadly, I understand that our audience\\ntoday includes several members of the Regional Economic Advisory Council - including the\\nUniversity at Albany's president, George Philip and Michael Castellana, the co-chair of the\\nCouncil - who are working to advance such partnerships and the outlook for the region.\\nGoing forward, the industry-higher education partnerships taking place here will be\\nincreasingly important. I expect the strong foundation already in place will help maintain the\\neconomic vitality of the capital region.\\nConclusion\\nTo sum up, growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to\\nbring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the\\nfinancial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which\\nhas risen in recent months, is poised to moderate soon. The Fed is doing - and will continue\\nto do - everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\\nLooking ahead, the key challenge for the Albany area will be to continue to prepare its\\nresidents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding education and skills will go a long\\nway to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\\nThank you for your kind attention.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2024,\n          2013,\n          2009\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"month\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"CFNAI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0200021052719692,\n        \"min\": -18.12,\n        \"max\": 6.27,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 150,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.53,\n          -0.47,\n          -0.15\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, and Cleaning**\n","\n","In this step, we preprocess the speech text by **tokenizing, removing stopwords, and eliminating punctuation** to prepare the data for further analysis.\n","\n","### **1.

It is a pleasure to join you for today's meeting of the Forum Club of\\nthe Palm Beaches. It is truly humbling for me to be invited to speak to your\\nmembership, in the company of the many influential leaders, authors, and other public\\nfigures this organization has hosted since its founding in 1976.\\nBefore turning to the main topic of my remarks today, I want to briefly share with you a\\nbit about my background. I am one of the longest serving members currently on the\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), having served as a Board\\nmember since November 26, 2018. As a member of the Board, I am a permanent\\nvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and serve in other\\ncapacities-I lead the Board committees on smaller and community banks and on\\nconsumer and community affairs and serve as a member on other committees that\\nbroadly address supervision and regulation and payments. I also provide input into the\\nfull range of matters that come before the Board.\\nI am the first Governor appointed to fill the role created by Congress for someone with\\ndemonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks, banks\\n2\\nwith less than $10 billion in assets. I have been both a banker, working in the\\ncommunity bank owned and operated by my family since 1882, and a bank\\nsupervisoras the Kansas State Bank Commissioner. Early in my career, I spent almost a decade\\nworking in public service in several federal government roles, including setting up the\\nDepartment of Homeland Security after 9/11 and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and\\npolicy advisor to the first Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge. I also served as a\\ncounsel on several U.S. House Committees, and as a staff member for the former U.S.\\nSenator from Kansas, Bob Dole.\\nThese experiences have provided me with a uniquely broad perspective about the role\\nof government and the functioning of the U.S. economy-from the view of a regulated\\nbusiness, an executive branch agency, the legislative branch, and state and federal\\nregulatory agencies.\\nThroughout my career, but particularly in my current role as a member of the Board of\\nGovernors, I have approached my responsibilities in an independent way, relying on\\nfacts, analysis, my own experience and judgment, and the pursuit of the\\ncongressionally mandated goals that guide the work of the Board.\\nIn some cases, this approach has led me to depart from the views of my colleagues. At\\nits September meeting, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds\\nrate, for the first time since we began tightening to combat inflation, by 1/2 percentage\\npoint to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. I dissented from that decision, preferring instead to lower the\\ntarget range by 1/4 percentage point. In my statement published after the meeting, I\\nagreed with the Committee's assessment that, given the progress we have seen since\\nthe middle of 2023 on both lowering inflation and cooling the labor market, it was\\nappropriate to reflect this progress by beginning the process of recalibrating the policy\\nstance toward a more neutral setting. As my statement noted, I preferred a smaller\\ninitial cut in the policy rate. With inflation continuing to hover well above our 2 percent\\ngoal, I saw the risk that the Committee's large policy action might be interpreted as a\\npremature declaration of victory on our price-stability mandate. In addition, with the U.S.\\neconomy remaining strong, moving the policy rate down too quickly, in my view, would\\ncarry the risk of stoking demand unnecessarily and potentially reigniting inflationary\\npressures.\\nMy dissent was notable in that the last dissenting vote from a Fed Board member on an\\nFOMC vote occurred nearly 20 years ago. My dissent was guided by my view and\\ninterpretation of the available data and my understanding of the Fed's dual mandate of\\nmaximum employment and stable prices, which I will discuss more in a moment.\\nEveryone in this room knows that experience is important. My experiences have\\nshaped and reinforced my views on how policymakers can best serve the\\npublicnarrowly, including in monetary policy decisionmaking and the regulation of the banking\\nindustry, but also more broadly in thinking about policymaking in support of an agency's\\nmission balanced with its extensive impact on the affected industry and the U.S.\\neconomy.\\nA Pragmatic Approach to Policymaking\\nA Goal-Oriented Approach\\nIn the past, I have discussed the role of policymaking from the perspective of a Federal\\nReserve Board member. But taking a step back, there are some broader themes\\nrelevant to agency policymaking more generally, themes that are useful beyond the\\ncontext of the Federal Reserve. At a basic level, I think of this as a pragmatic approach.\\nIt requires tradeoffs to balance regulation while also not inhibiting economic growth.\\nThe first question I like to ask when confronted with a policy issue is, \\\"Why are we\\nhere?\\\" You may recognize this question from Philosophy 101, but this question also\\napplies to the exercise of executive authority by regulatory agencies. The Federal\\nReserve has extensive responsibilities, and equally extensive powers, but it must\\nexercise these powers only in furtherance of specific goals established by statute. The\\nsheer scope of the Fed's powers can present a temptation to go beyond the statutory\\nauthority. For example, to play a more active role in the allocation of credit, or to\\ndisplace other sources of bank funding even when market sources of liquidity are\\nfunctioning well. It could also include the temptation to venture into policy matters\\nunrelated to the Fed's responsibilities that are better addressed by Congress or other\\npolicymakers (here, a push for banking sector climate change related regulation comes\\nto mind). The goals Congress has laid out for the Fed are complicated and important.\\nCongress should not expect the Federal Reserve, or any other agency for that matter,\\nto solve problems beyond that agency's limited purpose. Doing so would contravene\\nthe intent and authority of Congress.\\nTo begin, I will provide a few concrete examples of how the starting point for policy is\\nthe agency's mission, including in: (1) the execution of monetary policy, and (2) the\\nconduct of banking regulation and supervision.\\nIn conducting monetary policy, Congress has given us the dual mandate of maximum\\nemployment and price stability. Achieving these goals has often proven challenging,\\nparticularly over the last several years, as these policy objectives can sometimes be in\\ntension. Policy actions to tame inflation, like raising the target range for the federal\\nfunds rate, can have an adverse effect on employment. A critical input to the FOMC\\ndecisionmaking process is an analysis of economic conditions and outlook. The real\\neconomy continues to be strong, with solid momentum in economic activity, robust\\nhousehold spending and business investment, and a healthy labor market that remains\\nnear full employment. Although economic conditions have been supportive of our\\nemployment mandate, they have been unsatisfying for our price stability mandate as\\ninflation continues to be elevated.\\nWe have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but\\nprogress seems to have stalled in recent months. The 12-month measure of core\\npersonal consumption expenditures inflation-which excludes food and energy\\npriceshas moved sideways at around 2.7 percent since May, and the latest consumer and\\nproducer price index reports point to a similarly elevated or even higher reading for\\nOctober. The persistently high core inflation largely reflects pressures on housing\\nservices prices, perhaps due to an increase in demand for affordable housing and an\\ninelastic supply.\\nGross domestic product (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the third quarter,\\nmaintaining the momentum from the previous four quarters. Growth continued to be\\ndriven by private domestic final purchases, as personal consumption, and retail sales in\\nparticular, strongly increased last quarter, more than offsetting further weakness in\\nhousing activity due to high mortgage rates. Retail sales continued to rise in October,\\neven though Hurricanes Helene and Milton may have exerted a small drag on sales last\\nmonth. The annual revision of the national income and product accounts confirmed that\\nGDP has been providing the right signal about the ongoing strength in economic\\nactivity, as gross domestic income and personal income were revised up considerably\\nfor 2023 and the first half of this year.\\nThe October employment report seems to have been affected by the recent hurricanes\\nand the Boeing strike. It also featured the lowest response rate to the payroll survey in\\ndecades. After accounting for these special factors, it seems that payroll employment\\ncontinued to increase in October at a pace close to the average monthly gain seen in\\nthe second and third quarters. The unemployment rate remained low at 4.1 percent in\\nOctober, down from 4.3 percent in July. The labor force participation rate remains well\\nbelow pre-pandemic levels and edged down further in October due to lower prime-age\\nparticipation. While unemployment is notably higher than a year ago, it is still at a\\nhistorically low level and below my and the Congressional Budget Office's estimates of\\nfull employment.\\nThe labor market has loosened from the extremely tight conditions of the past few\\nyears. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has been close to the\\nhistorically elevated pre-pandemic level in recent months. But there are still more\\navailable jobs than available workers, a condition that before 2018 has only occurred\\ntwice for a prolonged period since World War II, further signaling ongoing labor market\\nstrength. Wage growth has slowed further in recent months, but it continues to indicate\\na tight labor market.\\nThe rise in the unemployment rate this year largely reflects weaker hiring, as job\\nseekers entering or re-entering the labor force are taking longer to find work, while\\nlayoffs remain low. In addition to some cooling in labor demand, a mismatch between\\nthe skills of the new workers and available jobs could further raise unemployment,\\nsuggesting that higher unemployment has been partly driven by the stronger supply of\\nworkers.\\nMonetary Policy\\nIn the monetary policy function, we rely on the best data available, but without question\\nthe data are imperfect. We also consider a range of possible future economic conditions\\nto help inform our monetary policy decisionmaking, which requires that we make\\nassumptions and predictions about the future. Looking back over time, our crystal ball\\nhas never been perfect at predicting the risks that may emerge, how those risks may\\ninfluence economic conditions, and how that should be considered in analyzing our\\nmonetary policy goals. To illustrate this point in terms of recent events, we have not yet\\nmet our inflation goal and, as I noted earlier, progress in lowering inflation appears to\\nhave stalled.\\nI see greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor\\nmarket remains near full employment, but it is also possible that we could see a\\ndeterioration in labor market conditions. These predictions always come with a dose of\\nhumility, however, particularly because they rely on imperfect data. The labor market\\ndata have become increasingly difficult to interpret, as surveys and other\\nmeasurements struggle to incorporate large numbers of new workers and to account for\\nother influences that we do not yet fully understand and have not yet been able to\\naccurately measure. As the dynamics of immigration and business creation and\\nclosures continue to change, it has become increasingly difficult to understand the\\npayroll employment data. In light of the dissonance created by conflicting economic\\nsignals, measurement challenges, and data revisions, I remain cautious about taking\\nsignal from only a limited set of real-time data releases.\\nWhile the mandate for monetary policy is straightforward, its execution is complex. Our\\ndecisions are guided by our dual mandate, but arriving at them entails careful analysis\\nof sometimes flawed data, and informed judgments about unknowable future conditions.\\nBank Regulation and Supervision\\nIn conducting bank regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve promotes the safe\\nand sound operation of individual banks, and the stability of the broader financial\\nsystem. These bank regulatory goals have obvious synergies-individual banks\\noperating in a safe and sound manner tends to create conditions that promote financial\\nstability in the banking sector. The Fed's bank regulatory objectives include implicit\\ntradeoffs: we aim to foster a banking system that is safe, sound, and efficient, while\\nserving the U.S. economy, and facilitating economic growth. The objectives must also\\nsupport the full breadth of the banking system from the very largest to the very smallest.\\nStriking a balance among these competing goals can certainly be a challenge, and\\npolicy views on where that balance should be struck may vary. We should approach the\\ntask of bank regulation with an understanding and appreciation of these tradeoffs,\\ncoupled with an affirmative acknowledgment that the banking system is an important\\ndriver of business formation, economic expansion, and opportunity. A banking system\\nthat is safe and sound yet irrelevant would not fulfill our regulatory objectives, but would\\nbe the inevitable outcome of following a path that strives for elimination of risks rather\\nthan promotion of effective risk management. Banks are unique individual businesses,\\nnot public utilities.\\nThe pursuit of these bank regulatory goals requires an approach that considers a range\\nof regulatory and supervisory tools, from the quantitative-like the setting of bank capital\\nand liquidity requirements-to the more subjective-like evaluating bank management\\nduring the examination process. And while the goals themselves seem straightforward,\\nthe tools available and the complexity and evolution of the financial system over time\\npresent real challenges from a policymaking perspective.\\nWhen we consider drafting a new regulation, we should always ask \\\"What problem\\nwould this new regulation solve?\\\" Policymakers should exercise restraint in the\\npromulgation of a new regulation, by articulating the problem it purports to solve and\\npresenting an efficient way to address it. Identifying the problem that requires\\naddressing often poses one of the most significant challenges. Ideally, the process\\nwould begin by identifying the problem, then move to an analysis of whether proposed\\nsolutions are within the agency's statutory authorities, and finally whether targeted\\nchanges to the regulatory framework could result in improvements, remediation of gaps,\\nor elimination of redundant and unnecessary requirements.\\nBut for a number of reasons, the problem identification process can result in\\nmisidentification of issues, and a resulting failure to prioritize the most important ones.\\nTake for example the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the regulatory response.\\nAt its root, this bank's failure exposed significant flaws in the bank's management and\\nthe regulators' oversight and supervision. The interest rate and funding risks, rapid\\ngrowth, and the idiosyncratic business model and concentrated customer base of the\\nbank, were apparent and obvious. These risks were mismanaged by SVB and not acted\\non early enough by bank supervisors.\\nThese were not the only factors contributing to the firm's failure, but these critical\\nelements should have been the key priorities for the supervisory function to address\\nafter the bank's failure. And yet in the aftermath of SVB's demise, we have focused on\\nregulatory proposals ranging from substantial increases in bank capital requirements, to\\npushing down global systemically important bank (G-SIB) and large bank requirements\\nto much smaller firms, finding supervisory deficiencies in the management of\\nwellcapitalized and financially sound firms, and considering widespread changes to the\\nfunding and liquidity requirements and expectations that apply to all banks.\\nA crisis is not a regulatory blank check. In some ways, it presents heightened risks that\\nshould prompt us to show our work even more carefully. A deliberate, transparent, and\\nfact-based approach to pursuing statutory objectives also serves the goal of avoiding\\nthe impression of pursuing unrelated policy goals, particularly those that venture into\\npolitical concerns outside of an agency's purposes or functions. Promoting safety,\\nsoundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory\\nallocation of credit-picking winners and losers-or promoting an ideological position\\nthrough more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination.\\nEffective and Efficient Solutions\\nOnce we have a clear and thorough understanding of our statutory objectives and have\\na framework to identify issues, gaps, or redundancies, the next task is to focus on\\nfinding efficient solutions to those issues. In doing so, we should consider policy\\nalternatives and perspectives that may differ from our past approach. We should also\\nacknowledge that we may not have all the facts or information necessary to\\nimmediately identify an effective solution. Successful policymaking requires openness\\nand humility, caution, and a deliberate approach.\\nWith respect to monetary policy, uncertainty surrounding available data and the many\\nvariables that can affect future economic conditions suggest that we should pursue a\\ncautious approach. At the most recent meeting in November, the Committee decided to\\ntake an additional step along the path of moving toward a more neutral policy setting. I\\nagreed to support this action, since it aligns with my preference to lower the policy rate\\ngradually, especially in light of elevated inflation and the uncertainty about the level of\\nthe neutral rate.\\nMy estimate of the neutral policy rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic,\\nand therefore we may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think. I\\nwould prefer to proceed cautiously in bringing the policy rate down to better assess how\\nfar we are from the end point, while recognizing that we have not yet achieved our\\ninflation goal and closely watching the evolution of the labor market. We should also not\\nrule out the risk that the policy rate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before\\nwe achieve our price stability goal.\\nIt is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC\\nmeeting, my colleagues and I will make our decisions based on the incoming data and\\nthe implications for and risks to the outlook and guided by the Fed's dual-mandate\\ngoals of maximum employment and stable prices. During each intermeeting period, we\\ntypically receive a range of economic data and information. In addition to closely\\nwatching the incoming data, I meet with a broad range of contacts to discuss economic\\nconditions as I assess the appropriateness of our monetary policy stance. Especially in\\nlight of the data measurement challenges that I mentioned earlier, engaging with\\ncontacts helps me interpret the signals provided by the data and gain a better\\nunderstanding of how the economy is evolving.\\nConsistent with this pragmatic approach, I am pleased that the November post meeting\\nstatement included a flexible, data-dependent approach, providing the Committee with\\noptionality in deciding future policy adjustments. As I noted earlier, my view is that\\ninflation remains a concern, and I continue to see price stability as essential for\\nfostering a strong labor market and an economy that works for everyone in the longer\\nterm.\\nIn banking regulation, this pragmatic approach requires us to consider the costs and\\nbenefits of any proposed change, as well as incentive effects, impacts on markets, and\\npotential unintended consequences. But it also means that we must consider the limits\\nof regulatory responsibility-grounded by our statutory objectives-when taking regulatory\\naction. In my view, these considerations apply beyond Federal Reserve policymaking to\\nregulatory actions taken by any agency.\\nAs I noted previously, statutory mandates guiding the Fed's bank regulatory\\nresponsibilities provide an important grounding for agency action. But they must be\\nviewed in the broader context of promoting an effective and efficient banking system\\nthat supports market functioning and encourages economic growth, business creation\\nand expansion, and opportunity. Our responsibility is not to look only at whether a\\nproposal will promote greater safety and soundness, but to consider the broader\\ncontext, including whether regulatory incentives will skew the allocation of credit,\\nadversely affect capital markets, or push traditional banking activities outside of the\\nbanking system into less regulated non-banks.\\nIs the bank regulatory framework efficient? Does it allow banks sufficient freedom and\\nflexibility to operate and meet customer needs? And importantly, are there areas within\\nthe approach to regulation and supervision that simply cannot be justified based on a\\ncost-benefit analysis? The answer to the latter is \\\"Yes.\\\" There are a number of areas\\nwhere right-sizing regulation and our supervisory approach would be appropriate and\\ncan be done in a way that does not sacrifice safety and soundness or threaten financial\\nstability.\\nRegulation is most effective when it strikes an appropriate balance between competing\\ngoals and objectives. In the banking system, this means operating in a safe, sound, and\\nfinancially stable way, while also supporting economic growth and efficiency. When we\\nfail to consider this broader context, we risk disincentivizing growth, imposing overly\\nburdensome and unnecessary regulations, setting opaque and unreasonable\\nexpectations through the supervisory process, and forcing the inefficient allocation of\\ncapital.\\nSometimes this debate escapes from the dusty offices of the banking regulators into\\nplain view, as during the past year on the Basel III Endgame package of bank capital\\nreforms. While this proposal prompted extensive comment from a wide range of\\ncommenters, it also inspired a negative television and radio advertising campaign,\\nwhich is unprecedented for a relatively technical bank regulatory issue. But these ads\\nhighlighted an uncomfortable truth: the regulatory approach we took failed to consider\\nor deliver a reasonable proposal, one aligned with the original Basel agreement yet\\nsuited to the particulars of the U.S. banking system. Instead, the proposal released last\\nyear opted for significant capital increases for some banks, in excess of 20 percent,\\ndeparting significantly from the approach adopted by our international counterparts.\\nThis public engagement has been useful, and it seems to have softened some of the\\nover-calibrated positions underpinning the original capital reform proposal. But this level\\nof public engagement and debate was also a byproduct of the rulemaking process.\\nWhile regulatory overreach can threaten the credibility of agency action in the eyes of\\nthe public, a transparent process allows public commenters to pressure test and\\npushback on agency action.\\nHowever, when agencies overwhelm the process by publishing thousands of pages of\\nrulemakings in a short period of time, the public's ability to provide meaningful feedback\\non our rules is compromised. Last year the federal financial agencies published over\\n5,000 pages of rules and proposals. And yet, even when the public is able to comment\\non these voluminous proposals, regulators often ignore this constructive feedback and\\nmove forward to publish final rules with minimal or no changes relative to their\\nproposals, as with the Community Reinvestment Act rule.\\nMaintenance of an existing regulatory framework is not glamorous but is perhaps one of\\nthe more important agency functions to ensure that the framework is striking the right\\nbalance between promoting a strong banking system and supporting economic growth.\\nThis requires reviewing and updating regulations to ensure that prior agency actions\\n3\\ncontinue to address problems efficiently as industries and conditions change. When\\nagencies prioritize the creation of new regulation in the absence of a statutory mandate,\\nharmful and unintended consequences can result. One such example is the adverse\\neffects of regulatory constraints on Treasury market functioning. Rules like the\\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio, the G-SIB Surcharge, and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio\\npose known and identified constraints on the Treasury market that may contribute to\\nfuture stress and market disruption if left unaddressed.\\nFinally, while transparency-like that intended by the rulemaking process-can lead to\\nbetter public engagement and outcomes, it is important that agency actions are\\ntransparent even when not legally mandated. The most obvious opportunity for\\nadditional transparency in the banking framework is in supervision. Supervision by its\\nnature involves confidential and detailed inquiries into bank operations, with examiners\\nevaluating quantitative measures like capital and liquidity, while making judgmental\\nassessments of the activities and risks of the institution, and its risk-management\\napproach. Supervisory expectations should not surprise regulated firms, and yet\\ntransparency of these expectations is often challenging to achieve. In fact, since the\\nfailure of SVB supervisory surprises have become more common in bank examinations.\\nIn light of the recent Supreme Court cases regarding agency actions, agencies should\\nrespond in a way that furthers the goals of transparency and accountability, and act as\\na check on regulatory overreach. The elimination of Chevron deference has the\\npotential to transform agency rulemakings positively-in a way that promotes the\\npragmatic approach I outlined in this discussion. The same considerations we follow in\\nthe pursuit of our statutory objectives could help support rulemakings that are built upon\\na stronger factual and analytical basis, with a thorough and more comprehensive\\nexplanation of an agency's policy approach.\\nClosing Thoughts\\nWhile my remarks today have largely focused on Federal Reserve responsibilities, a\\npragmatic approach has broader applicability. Agencies can build public support for\\ntheir activities by following these simple principles-a rigorous focus on statutory\\nobjectives, a foundation based on facts and careful analysis in forming policy, crafting\\nefficient solutions, and public transparency and accountability. Agencies and their\\nregulated businesses will benefit from a rigorous process that considers different\\nperspectives, the intended and unintended consequences of decisions, and the costs\\nand benefits of actions. The ability of the banking system to finance the future growth of\\nthe U.S. economy hinges upon our ability and willingness to shift our approach to\\nregulation and supervisory oversight. A pragmatic approach to policymaking will better\\nenable the U.S. economy to continue to grow now and into the future.\\n1\\nThe views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my\\ncolleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\\n2\\nSee 12 U.S.C. \\u00a7 241.\\n3\\nIn February, the Board announced the initiation of its review of its regulations to\\nidentify those regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in\\naccordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.

I thought I\\nmight use my time with you to address the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC)\\nongoing effort to return inflation to our 2 percent target while keeping the labor market\\nand the economy strong.1\\nAfter significant progress in reducing inflation and evident moderation in the labor\\nmarket, in September the Committee judged that the time had come to begin easing\\nmonetary policy toward a more neutral setting to limit the risk of unduly weakening the\\nlabor market as progress continues toward 2 percent inflation. After reducing the policy\\nrate 75 basis points since our September meeting, I believe that monetary policy is still\\nrestrictive and putting downward pressure on inflation without creating undesirable\\nweakness in the labor market. I expect rate cuts to continue over the next year until we\\napproach a more neutral setting of the policy rate.\\nBut recent data have raised the possibility that progress on inflation may be stalling at a\\nlevel meaningfully above 2 percent. This risk has raised concerns that the FOMC\\nshould consider holding the policy rate constant at our upcoming meeting to collect\\nmore information about the future path of inflation and the economy. Based on the\\neconomic data in hand today and forecasts that show that inflation will continue on its\\ndownward path to 2 percent over the medium term, at present I lean toward supporting\\na cut to the policy rate at our December meeting. But that decision will depend on\\nwhether data that we will receive before then surprises to the upside and alters my\\nforecast for the path of inflation.\\nLet me turn to the economic outlook. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a\\nstrong annual pace of 2.8 percent in the third quarter of 2024, and indications are that\\ngrowth in the fourth quarter will be a bit slower. An average of private sectors forecasts\\npredicts 2.2 percent, while based on fairly limited data so far, the Atlanta Fed's\\nGDPNow model currently predicts 3.2 percent.\\nOn the consumer side of the economy, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\nincreased 0.1 percent in October after a 0.5 percent rise in September. Given the\\nrecent volatility in these numbers, I won't read too much into the monthly swing. The\\nmodest increase in October might partially reflect some payback to the stronger growth\\nin September. Overall, household balance sheets continue to be in generally good\\nshape, and this position should help maintain spending going forward.\\nOn the business side of the economy, the S&P Global U.S. manufacturing purchasing\\nmanagers index (PMI) rose slightly in November but still stands at a level indicating a\\nslight deterioration in overall business conditions among manufacturers for the fifth\\nstraight month. Today's Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey had a\\nsimilar leaning. These readings are consistent with industrial production data for\\nmanufacturing remaining flat, as it has been for the past several months.\\nBut these aggregate data mask quite different performances for interest-sensitive\\nsectors and other businesses not so affected by rates. In the spring of 2022, when the\\nFOMC began raising interest rates, production by more interest rate-sensitive\\nmanufacturers, such as business equipment, grew at about the same rate as production\\nby less rate-sensitive manufacturers. But starting around the middle of 2023, when the\\npolicy rate hit its peak, those stories diverged, and production by interest-sensitive\\nmanufacturing declined, while other manufacturing rose, driving a sizable gap between\\nthe two types of industries. This divergence is an indication to me that, even after the\\nCommittee cut rates 75 basis points, restrictive policy is working the way it is intended\\nto, affecting production in sectors where rates matter. It is also a reminder that there is\\nstill some distance to go in reducing the policy rate to neutral. As that occurs, I expect\\nthe gap between the two types of industries will narrow. As for the service sector, which\\nis the larger share of business activity, the November S&P Global U.S. PMI continued\\nto increase, extending the strong momentum for services over the past year or two.\\nWhile the picture for economic activity is pretty clear right now across the major data\\nthat we look at, things aren't as clear in recent data on the labor market. As expected,\\nthe October employment report showed very little increase in the number of jobs, but\\nlikely because of the temporary effects of the recent hurricanes and the strike at\\nBoeing, which also affected businesses serving Boeing and its workers. The strike is\\nover, and it is likely that most of the job losses from the hurricane have reversed. So I\\ndo expect a rebound in payroll data in the November employment report that is due out\\nlater this week, but it may take more time for the full swings in the payroll data to fully\\nwash out.\\nFor that reason, I am leaning on other metrics to reveal what is really going on in the\\nlabor market. And when I look at a broader range of data, it tells a fairly consistent story\\nover the past year about moderating demand relative to supply, consistent with\\ncontinued progress toward 2 percent inflation and without an undesirable weakening in\\nthe labor market.\\nThe unemployment rate started 2024 at 3.7 percent and climbed gradually, briefly\\nhitting 4.3 percent before falling back down to 4.1 percent in September and October.\\nWhile that is still quite low in historical terms, it indicates a labor market significantly\\nlooser than we saw from the middle of 2022 to the middle of 2023, when unemployment\\nwas close to 3.5 percent and fast wage growth contributed to high inflation. Other data\\nsharpen this image of a looser but still-strong labor market. The share of workers\\nvoluntarily quitting their jobs, an indication of tightness in the labor market, has trended\\ndown to levels lower than before the pandemic. The number of job openings continues\\nto gradually fall, another sign of moderating demand relative to supply, but the number\\nof layoffs is still low, consistent with a healthy labor market.\\nGrowth in wages and other forms of compensation has moderated at the same time\\nthat labor productivity has grown strongly. This story is very different than a couple of\\nyears ago when, for example, average hourly wages grew at an annual rate above 5\\npercent in 2022, at the same time that the productivity of workers was declining. This\\ndouble whammy put significant upward pressure on inflation. But over the second and\\nthird quarters of 2024, average hourly wages have grown at less than a 4 percent\\nannual rate, while productivity has grown around 2 percent. The math is pretty simple-4\\npercent wage growth minus the 2 percent gain from higher productivity tells you that\\nwage growth is consistent with bringing inflation down to 2 percent.2\\nWhile I am pleased at how well the labor market has held up under restrictive monetary\\npolicy, I am less pleased about what the data have been telling us the past couple of\\nmonths about inflation. After making a lot of progress over the past year and a half, the\\nrecent data indicate that progress may be stalling. Inflation based on the Commerce\\nDepartment's measure of prices for PCE rose more than expected in September and\\nOctober and so did \\\"core\\\" PCE inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy\\nprices and is a better guide to future inflation. Three-month annualized core PCE\\ninflation has risen over the past two months, while six-month annualized inflation has\\nmade only a small improvement. These rates now stand at 2.8 percent and 2.3 percent,\\nrespectively. These recent readings have contributed to 12-month core PCE inflation of\\n2.8 percent in October.\\nIf we compare components of core inflation this October with last October, we see\\n12month housing services inflation has softened and goods inflation has moved to slight\\ndeflation, but there has been an increase in nonmarket core services excluding\\nhousing. Overall, I feel like an MMA fighter who keeps getting inflation in a choke hold,\\nwaiting for it to tap out yet it keeps slipping out of my grasp at the last minute. But let\\nme assure you that submission is inevitable-inflation isn't getting out of the octagon.\\nWhile the recent increase and the level of inflation raise concerns that it may be getting\\nstuck above the FOMC's 2 percent goal, let me emphasize that this is a risk but not a\\ncertainty. I take the recent inflation data seriously, but we saw a similar uptick in\\ninflation a year ago that was followed by a continued decline, so I also don't want to\\noverreact. And I expect housing services inflation to continue to moderate and I do not\\ntake much signal from the elevated inflation for other non-market services.\\nNow let me turn to the implications for monetary policy based on my assessment of the\\nunderlying economic outlook. While some near-term aspects of the outlook may be a\\nlittle unclear, something that is clear is the direction for monetary policy and our policy\\nrate over the medium term, which is down. This downward trajectory reflects the fact\\nthat the level of aggregate demand in the economy, relative to supply, has moderated\\nsignificantly over the past year-it is plainly visible in the data on spending and the labor\\nmarket. Inflation over that time is also significantly lower, so it makes sense to be\\nmoving policy rates toward a more neutral setting.\\nAnd there is a ways to go. In September, the median of the projections of FOMC\\nparticipants was that the federal funds rate would be 3.4 percent at the end of next\\nyear, which is about 100 basis points lower than it is today. That number can and\\nprobably will change over time, but whatever the destination, there will be a variety of\\nways to get there, with the speed and timing of cuts determined by economic conditions\\nwe encounter on the way.\\nThe motivation for continuing to cut the policy rate at the FOMC's next meeting begins\\nwith how restrictive the current setting is. After we cut by 75 basis points, I believe the\\nevidence is strong that policy continues to be significantly restrictive and that cutting\\nagain will only mean that we aren't pressing on the brake pedal quite as hard. Although\\nmonthly core inflation has flattened out in recent months, there is no indication that the\\npace of price increases for key service categories such as housing and nonmarket\\nservices should remain at their current levels or increase. Another factor that supports a\\nfurther rate cut is that the labor market appears to finally be in balance, and we should\\naim to keep it that way.\\nConversely, based on what we know today, one could argue that there is a case for\\nskipping a rate cut at the next meeting. Monthly readings on inflation have moved up\\nnoticeably recently, and we don't know whether this uptick in inflation will persist, or\\nreverse, as we saw a year ago. Due to strikes and hurricanes, recent labor market data\\nare giving us a cloudy view of the true state of the labor market that won't be clearer for\\na couple of months. As a result, one could advocate for not changing the policy rate at\\nour upcoming meeting and adjusting our policy stance in a measured way going\\nforward. In fact, if policymakers' estimates of the target range at the end of next year\\nare close to correct, then the Committee will most likely be skipping rate cuts multiple\\ntimes on the way to that destination.\\nIn deciding which of these two approaches to take at the FOMC's next meeting, I will be\\nwatching additional data very closely. Tomorrow, we get the Labor Department's Job\\nOpenings and Labor Turnover Survey. On Friday, we get the employment report, which,\\nas I noted, may have misleading payroll data. Then next week, we get consumer and\\nproducer price indexes for November, which will allow a good estimate of PCE inflation\\nfor the month. Finally, on the first day of the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales\\ndata for November that will give us an idea of how consumer spending is holding up.\\nAll of that information will help me decide whether to cut or skip. As of today, I am\\nleaning toward continuing the work we have started in returning monetary policy to a\\nmore neutral setting. Policy is still restrictive enough that an additional cut at our next\\nmeeting will not dramatically change the stance of monetary policy and allow ample\\nscope to later slow the pace of rate cuts, if needed, to maintain progress toward our\\ninflation target. That said, if the data we receive between today and the next meeting\\nsurprise in a way that suggests our forecasts of slowing inflation and a moderating but\\nstill-solid economy are wrong, then I will be supportive of holding the policy rate\\nconstant. I will be watching the incoming data closely over the next couple weeks to\\nhelp me make my decision as to what path to take.\\n1\\nThe views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my\\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\\n2\\nA similar story holds true if one looks at growth in labor productivity and hourly\\ncompensation from the Productivity and Cost release.

Kugler\\nMember\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\\nat the\\nAlbert Hirschman Lecture\\n2024 Annual Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Economic Association and the\\nLatin American and Caribbean Chapter of the Econometric Society\\nMontevideo, Uruguay\\nNovember 14, 2024\\nThank you for your generous introduction, Marcela, and thank you for the\\nopportunity to be here and speak to you today.1 I believe I am the first central banker\\nfrom the U.S. to address this annual meeting, but I know, and am proud to say, that I am\\nthe first who is also Latin American. And, of course, I have been part of the LACEA\\nExecutive Committee and I have presented papers at many LACEA conferences over the\\nyears, so it is a pleasure to be back here among many colleagues.\\nWhen the United States suffered very high inflation beginning in 2021, it was a\\nnew and unfamiliar experience for many too young to recall the last time this occurred in\\nthe 1970s and 1980s. Of course, very high inflation is not such a distant memory for\\npeople from Latin America and the Caribbean, and that includes me. Growing up in\\nColombia, I vividly recall the daily challenges of trying to plan and live with sustained\\ndouble-digit inflation, and I especially remember the pain it imposed on disadvantaged\\npeople.\\nGaining control over inflation requires a commitment by society to accept the\\ntradeoffs and sacrifices often needed, and it also requires deliberate and principled\\ndecision making by central banks.2 Central bankers must both formulate their best\\njudgment of the correct policies that will achieve a desired level of inflation and follow\\nthrough by executing and maintaining those policies. It has been widely recognized-\\nand is a finding of economic research-that central bank independence is fundamental to\\nachieving good policy and good economic outcomes. It is not sufficient by itself to\\nachieve those goals, but, over time, it is almost always necessary.\\n- 2 -\\nLet me start by defining terms. An independent central bank is one that can carry\\nout monetary policy insulated from pressures arising from other parts of government or\\nelsewhere. When there is central bank independence, the role of national or jurisdictional\\ngovernments is typically one of representing the public in specifying a mandate for the\\ncentral bank and holding the central bank accountable by monitoring its performance and\\nappointing central bank leadership. In this arrangement, the public, through\\nrepresentative government, specifies the overall objectives that central banks should\\npursue.\\nSome noteworthy examples of central bank mandates include the dual mandate\\nestablished by the U.S. Congress that requires the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal\\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) to promote maximum employment and price stability.\\nThe European Central Bank's primary mandate of price stability is spelled out in a treaty\\nenacted by the legislatures of its constituent member states. The central bank of Brazil\\npursues price stability as its primary objective as well. In the United Kingdom, its\\nparliament has mandated that the Bank of England pursue monetary and financial\\nstability.3 Similarly, the objectives of the central banks of Chile and Uruguay are both to\\nkeep inflation low and stable and to foster the stability and efficiency of the financial\\nsystem.\\nBefore we discuss why monetary policy independence can benefit the economy,\\nlet me take a step back and discuss the tradeoffs associated with the conduct of monetary\\npolicy. Central banks significantly influence prices, interest rates, employment, and\\nincome in the economy, so it is natural that sometimes there would be differing views on\\n- 3 -\\ntheir decisions. For instance, monetary policy actions that promote economic activity and\\nemployment growth can put upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, policies to lower\\ninflation tend to slow economic activity and employment growth. This tradeoff typically\\nmeans that returning inflation to a specific target level when inflation has been allowed to\\nrun high may require more restrictive policy and a reduction in demand and higher\\nunemployment. As I pointed out in a speech last spring at Stanford University, however,\\nwe have seen this tradeoff dissipate over the past couple of years, pointing to the\\npossibility that we have been now for some time on the steep part of the Phillips curve,\\nwhere inflation can come down substantially without a big increase in unemployment.\\nYet there is a possibility that this tradeoff may become more prominent as we move\\ntoward the flatter part of the Phillips curve.\\nThe economic literature points out that striking a balance in these tradeoffs can be\\ndifficult for an elected or otherwise representative government for various reasons. One\\nreason highlighted in the literature is that an elected government may be naturally\\nfocused on the short-term goals of its constituents and may have an incentive to try to\\nlower the unemployment rate in the short run, with less concern about the longer-term\\neffects on inflation and growth. The literature has labeled this fundamental problem\\n\\\"time inconsistency.\\\"4 This incentive may generate undesirable economic cycles,\\npotentially destabilizing prices. And if the public learns over time that the central bank is\\nresponsive to these incentives to increase inflation to boost employment temporarily,\\nexpectations of future inflation would rise, a symptom of a loss of credibility of the\\nmonetary policy authority. Governments also may have an incentive to increase inflation\\n- 4 -\\nto monetize their debts, which become effectively smaller as the purchasing power of\\nmoney declines. Also, if elected officials are responsible for monetary policy decisions,\\nthe typical alternation in control of government between different parties may lead to\\ndifferent preferences in the tradeoff between employment and inflation, destabilizing\\nprices and the economy in the long term.5 In summary, economic research argues that\\ndemands on government to address concerns in the short term may result in excessively\\ndiscretionary monetary policy and do not provide the best incentives for effective\\nmonetary policy that promotes the long-term health of the economy.\\nA solution devised by governments and explored in economic research is to\\ndelegate monetary policy to an independent entity: the central bank.6 By establishing\\npolicy mandates in laws or treaties, the government voluntarily constrains itself from\\nsuddenly altering policy, and thus it also discourages public pressure to do so. As in\\nHomer's Odyssey, in which Odysseus asks his crew to tie him to the mast of his ship to\\navoid being bewitched by the Sirens' songs, policy mandates help central banks avoid\\nbeing swayed by short-term desires to the detriment of longer-term goals.\\nNow that we have discussed the reasons for delegating the authority to conduct\\nmonetary policy to an independent entity, we are left with the task of describing how\\nsuch independence should be designed and implemented in practice. There are two broad\\ncategories of central bank independence. The first of these is goal independence-to\\nwhat extent is the central bank free to define its goals? The research literature makes a\\n- 5 -\\ndistinction between instrument independence-the prerogative to make monetary policy\\ndecisions, which I will discuss more later-and goal independence.7 In particular, the\\nFederal Reserve's goals are defined by law, so it is not goal independent. Nevertheless,\\nin spelling out those goals, the law provides the Federal Reserve with some degree of\\nindependence in defining them in detail.\\nFirst, let's talk about the extent to which the law has defined the Federal\\nReserve's monetary policy goals. Unlike some other central banks that target inflation,\\nthe FOMC has been handed two coequal goals-maximum employment and price\\nstability. The Committee is not free to pursue one or the other-it must pursue both.\\nAnd these two sides of the mandate are pretty clear. Maximum employment means, in\\neffect, the lowest unemployment rate that is consistent with stable prices. The law does\\nnot spell out a level of inflation that fulfills the goal of stable prices, but it has\\ntraditionally been viewed as a low and stable inflation rate.\\nMandates limit goal independence, but the form of those mandates can allow\\nsome role for the central bank in setting out its goals. The 1977 law defined the Federal\\nReserve's dual mandate, allowing the FOMC to work out the details. In 2012, the FOMC\\ndefined price stability as a longer-run annual inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by\\nthe Commerce Department's estimate of the rate of increase in the personal consumption\\nexpenditures (PCE) deflator. Because maximum employment is unobserved and likely\\nchanges over time, it can be estimated only with considerable uncertainty; thus, the\\nCommittee chose not to define it in numerical terms. But Committee participants\\n- 6 -\\nestimate a related number, the longer-run rate of unemployment, which is published\\nevery three months in the Summary of Economic Projections.\\nAnother aspect of independence is instrument independence, which affords\\ncentral banks flexibility in how to use the tools of monetary policy, such as policy interest\\nrates, to achieve their goals. In the case of the FOMC, instrument independence has\\nallowed it to adopt new ways to achieve its goals, as the financial system has evolved\\nover the decades. This has been particularly important when the economy faced\\nunprecedented challenges, as it did during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and during\\nthe 2020 pandemic. Because of this flexibility, the Federal Reserve Board and the\\nFOMC were able to respond promptly and, as it turned out, very effectively.\\nAcross countries and jurisdictions, goal independence and instrument\\nindependence have different dimensions and many variations. In some countries,\\nincluding India, Brazil, and South Korea, the targets for inflation rates are jointly decided\\nby the central bank and the ministry of finance. In contrast, the central banks of Chile,\\nColombia, Mexico, and Peru, among others, are given authority to choose their own\\ninflation objectives.\\nTo understand how governments have come to embrace the independence of\\ncentral banks, it is helpful to review how they have evolved from their origins in the 17th\\ncentury. Sweden's Riksbank was established by the private sector in 1688 to lend the\\ngovernment funds, and the Bank of England followed in 1694, with a similar structure\\nand purpose.8 Other European central banks followed in the 19th century and a wave of\\nmany more in the 20th, including the Federal Reserve. At different times, these central\\n- 7 -\\nbanks made the transition from wholly private to wholly public institutions and became\\naccountable to government, and by the mid-20th century, there was a growing\\nrecognition that independence made for a more practical and, ultimately, more effective\\ncentral bank. In the United States, the moment of truth came in 1951. During World\\nWar II, the Federal Reserve had agreed to peg interest rates on Treasury securities in\\norder to ensure smooth funding of the war effort, and after the war, it continued to peg\\nthe longer-term Treasury rate. In the early 1950s, inflation soared, but Treasury favored\\ncontinuing a cap on longer-term interest rates so that debt management costs could\\ncontinue to be low during the Korean War. After a series of high-level meetings, the\\nFederal Reserve and the Treasury reached an agreement in 1951 that freed the Fed from\\nthe obligation to fix interest rates and allowed it to use monetary policy independently to\\npursue national economic goals.\\nResearchers have analyzed the historical experiences of particular central banks,\\nsuch as the Federal Reserve, to understand the transition toward central bank\\nindependence and how it affects economic performance.9 In addition, researchers have\\nalso developed large cross-country indexes measuring the level of central bank\\nindependence while capturing multifaceted aspects of this independence based on banks'\\nlegal statutes over long periods.10 The empirical regularity that stands out in many\\ndifferent studies analyzing these indexes is the rise in central bank independence starting\\nin the 1980s, with studies analyzing at least 120 countries.11\\n- 8 -\\nEconomic research has cited several factors driving this adoption of central bank\\nindependence. In the 1980s and 1990s, emerging economies saw central bank\\nindependence as a way to facilitate access to global trade and financial markets, which\\nwere liberalized during that time.12 Another important factor was the experience of\\ndeveloping country debt crises during this period, which led to demands by creditor\\nbanks and international lenders for central bank independence.13\\nTo whatever extent these other factors pushed governments toward central bank\\nindependence, a consensus developed that such an arrangement yielded better economic\\noutcomes. Based on measures of central bank independence, researchers indeed have\\nfound a relationship between independence and lower inflation, especially for advanced\\neconomies.14 While evidence of a negative relationship between independence and\\ninflation has been a bit more elusive in the case of emerging market and developing\\neconomies (EMDEs), the economic literature does find a relationship between\\nindependence and lower inflation volatility in these countries.15 Among the reasons I\\nwould cite for why it is more difficult to find a relationship between independence and\\nlower inflation in EMDEs is that legal measures of central bank independence, also called\\n\\\"de jure independence,\\\" may not reflect the relationship between the central bank and the\\ngovernment that exists in practice-referred to as \\\"de facto independence.\\\" In countries\\nwhere the rule of law is not as strongly embedded in their institutions, there can be wide\\ngaps between the formal, legal institutional arrangements and their practical effect.16\\n- 9 -\\nIndeed, alternative measures of independence, such as turnover of central bank\\ngovernors, point to de facto measures being negatively associated with inflation,\\nespecially in emerging economies.17 Another possible reason is that emerging economies\\nmay be more exposed to volatile shocks and governmental regime changes, leading to\\ngreater turnover in central bank leadership and clouding the relationship between central\\nbank independence and inflation.18\\nThe relationship between central bank independence and lower inflation and\\ninflation volatility is therefore clear. But the connection to faster growth in economic\\nactivity is not. On the one hand, the primary reason for central bank independence in\\nmost countries with a single mandate is to provide price stability, so the lack of\\nassociation between monetary policy independence and adverse economic consequences\\nis not surprising.19 On the other hand, indexes of central bank independence may be\\nbiased. Most indexes of central bank independence tend to penalize the presence of\\nadditional mandates or responsibilities beyond price stability.20 However, a mandate that\\nexcludes full employment does not seem optimal, given that a central banker should\\nfocus on the consequences of its actions on long-term growth and economic activity.\\nResearch has emphasized complementarities between price stability, economic stability,\\nand financial stability, providing a rationale for these overlapping objectives at many\\ncentral banks.21 Also, in practice, although the recent inflation run-up showcased the\\ncommitment of most central banks to fight inflation, it also appears that they have been\\nwilling to provide some accommodation after having gained greater confidence that\\ninflationary pressures have dissipated. In fact, most central banks have initiated an\\neasing cycle even with inflation still somewhat above their respective targets and\\nregardless of the presence or not of an employment goal in their mandates.\\nSo if central bank independence does improve inflation outcomes, one question is\\nhow it accomplishes this. Let me return to an issue I mentioned earlier: credibility. If\\nthe central bank is credible about its longer-run inflation target, it would be a natural\\noutcome that long-run inflation expectations will tend to be closer to the target than when\\nthat credibility is lacking. And a central bank will be more credible if it takes actions that\\nlead the public to be confident that the central bank is actively pursuing its stated goal.\\nIt is possible to formalize the channel through which a central bank chooses a\\nlong-run inflation target and the public slowly learns about its commitment to achieving\\nit, thus gradually anchoring long-run expectations.22 The public observes inflation and\\neconomic activity outcomes as well as the central bank actions (say, changes in the\\nfederal funds rate), and it updates its long-run inflation expectations, which, in this\\nmodel, coincide with its perception of the long-run target. For instance, a nominal\\ninterest rate that is higher than expected, given observed inflation and economic activity\\nand the public's long-run inflation expectations, leads to an updated-lower-value of\\nthe perceived inflation target.\\nIf the central bank's policy actions are consistent with its long-run inflation goal,\\nthe public's long-run expectations will gradually settle at the central bank's long-run\\ngoal: This dynamic will anchor inflation expectations to the long-run target. The stock\\nof credibility of a central bank will be reflected in long-run inflation expectations moving\\nin a relatively narrow range close to the stated inflation goal. Conversely, inconsistent\\nactions will imply that agents will update their long-run expectations higher or lower,\\ndepending on the direction of surprises in central bank actions, causing de-anchoring of\\nexpectations. Despite a very large inflation shock starting in 2021, available measures of\\nlong-run inflation expectations, such as those in the Survey of Professional Forecasters or\\nthe Livingston Survey, increased just a bit compared with the inflation run-up and\\nquickly descended in 2023. That can be taken as a sign of anchoring and sufficient\\ncentral bank credibility through the lens of the model just described. And, to the extent\\nthat long-run inflation expectations matter to the dynamics of actual inflation, such as in\\nsome Phillips curve models, anchoring of inflation expectations is one of the key\\nelements leading to stable inflation.23\\nThe model also offers an interpretation of and a contrast to the behavior of\\ninflation and inflation expectations during the Great Inflation of the 1970s and in the\\npost-pandemic period. As inflation rose in the 1970s and monetary policy actions failed\\nto rein it in, the Federal Reserve lost credibility, and longer-term expectations of future\\ninflation rose toward the end of the decade. The Federal Reserve struggled for years to\\nrebuild that credibility, resulting in high and volatile inflation. Conversely, in the recent\\nepisode, inflation has traveled a long way from its peak, with no deterioration in\\neconomic activity and comparatively limited movement in long-run inflation\\nexpectations.\\nCredibility is enhanced by transparency and accountability, and I will conclude\\nwith a discussion of how these principles are carried out by the Federal Reserve. The\\nFederal Reserve seeks to explain as clearly as possible what it is trying to do in carrying\\nout its dual-mandate objectives and how it is trying to do it. Such transparency and\\naccountability are necessary under our democratic system but are perhaps especially\\nimportant for the Federal Reserve, which has been assigned such an important role in\\npromoting a healthy economy. In addition to conferring legitimacy for decisions,\\ntransparency makes monetary policy more effective, as the public better understands our\\nmonetary policy reaction function, which informs the public on how our decisions are\\nshaped by economic conditions. Monetary policy works in part by trying to influence the\\npublic's view of future economic conditions, so it is crucial that these intentions are\\nclearly communicated. The Federal Reserve promotes transparency by issuing a\\npostmeeting statement explaining its decision and then following up with more detailed\\nminutes three weeks later. Every three months, FOMC participants' projections for\\ninflation, unemployment, economic activity, and the likely path of monetary policy are\\npublished in the Summary of Economic Projections. The Chair conducts press\\nconferences after each FOMC meeting, and both the Chair and FOMC participants\\nfurther explain their reasoning on policy in speeches, news interviews, and other public\\nappearances. The Chair testifies to Congress on monetary policy twice a year,\\nresponding to questions from lawmakers. Transcripts of FOMC meetings are published\\nafter five years. More recently, the Fed has adopted the practice of periodically\\nreviewing its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, including\\nholding public Fed Listens sessions around the country to get public input.\\nTransparency is likewise seen in other economies as fundamental to monetary\\npolicy independence, which has increasingly been recognized for delivering better policy\\ndecisions that are more focused on the longer-term health of an economy. Research\\ncontinues to add to our understanding of the extent of these better outcomes in different\\neconomies and also how independence works in different institutional arrangements. The\\ngoal, of course, is more stable economies that deliver broadly rising living standards-in\\nLatin America, the Caribbean, and around the world.\\nLet me now turn to the current economic outlook in the United States and how\\nour monetary policy independence has permitted us to get where we are now. The United\\nStates has seen considerable disinflation while experiencing a cooling but still resilient\\nlabor market. Numbers just released this week show headline and core PCE inflation\\nhave fallen substantially from 7.1 percent to an estimated 2.3 percent and from 5.6\\npercent to an estimated 2.8 percent, respectively. While wage moderation and anchored\\ninflation expectations may allow us to continue making progress on inflation, stubborn\\nhousing inflation and high inflation in certain goods and services categories may stall\\nprogress in reaching our target. At the same time, labor markets have rebalanced, given\\ngreater labor supply from immigration and prime-age workers and lower demand from\\nrestrictive monetary policy. Thus, although the labor market experienced an extended\\nperiod of low unemployment and job creation these past several years and strong real\\nwage growth, the labor market has cooled. This combination of a continued but slowing\\ntrend in disinflation and cooling labor markets means that we need to continue paying\\nattention to both sides of our mandate. If any risks arise that stall progress or reaccelerate\\ninflation, it would be appropriate to pause our policy rate cuts. But if the labor market\\nslows down suddenly, it would be appropriate to continue to gradually reduce the policy\\nrate.\\nThank you again for inviting me to address you today. I would be glad to spend\\nsome time on further discussion of my presentation and to respond to your other\\nquestions.\\nReferences\\nAlesina, Alberto, and Andrea Stella (2010). \\\"The Politics of Monetary Policy,\\\" in Benjamin M.\\nFriedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3.\\nAmsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1001-54.\\nAlesina, Alberto, and Lawrence H.

Median inflation in that group (as defined by the International\\nMonetary Fund) has held near 2 percent for this decade. Indeed, in the IMF's latest World\\nEconomic Outlook, four out of five countries in this group are expected to post inflation rates\\nbetween 1 percent and 3 percent this year. That good performance has helped to anchor\\ninflation expectations, which, in turn, generates many benefits. Anchored inflation\\nexpectations damp the pass-through of supply-related price shocks. They also permit central\\nbanks to respond more forcefully to output fluctuations. Most significantly, the improved\\ninflation performance has come with, not at the expense of, output stability. Although a\\nconsensus has not formed on how much of the \\\"Great Moderation\\\" in the growth of real\\noutput can be attributed to monetary policy, everyone agrees that at least a portion of it can.\\nDavid views these macroeconomic outcomes as a triumph of monetarism, but not because\\nthe formulaic policy prescription associated with that doctrine succeeded (or, for that matter,\\nwas even tried on a sustained basis). Rather, the underlying tenets of monetarism ultimately\\nseeped into the collective central banking unconscious and fostered better decisionmaking.\\nThe beliefs that David identifies are threefold: That market economies are inherently\\nselfrighting, that open economies perform best under flexible exchange rates, and that central\\nbankers should focus on price stability as their long-run objective.\\nDavid suggests that monetarism failed when its proponents got too prescriptive by\\nadvocating rigid rules for money growth. Among the lessons he takes from the failed\\nmonetarist experiment are that central banking is an applied science and that our imperfect\\nunderstanding of how economies and markets function implies that a good dose of humility is\\nrequired - and I agree. As evidence of that humility on my part, let me also agree with David\\nthat two important questions about the conduct of monetary policy have not yet been\\nresolved. This is unfortunate because these two questions are both longstanding sources of\\ndebate and central to current policy concerns. First, what is the best way to pursue price\\nstability, and, second, how should asset prices be taken into account in steering policy?\\nIn many countries, though not my own, the answer to the first question has been that price\\nstability should be pursued through the formal apparatus of an inflation target, which typically\\nincludes establishing an inflation goal by the government, setting metrics to evaluate central\\nbank performance, and periodically communicating progress to the public. Although\\ncorrelation does not convey causation, the spread of such regimes has coincided with\\nsustained low global inflation. In addition, no adopter of an inflation target has subsequently\\nabandoned it.\\nBefore anyone jumps to the conclusion that Frankfurt is a stop on my road to Damascus, let\\nthis Saul state that for me the case remains open. Inflation has come down worldwide, in\\ncountries without, as well as with, inflation targets. Moreover, I share David's puzzlement\\nabout why an explicit inflation goal should make a substantial difference in performance\\ngiven the paucity of evidence showing that choosing a target directly affects the level of the\\npublic's inflation expectations. That said, I am relatively more persuaded that inflation\\ntargeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations. Evidence has accumulated to\\nsuggest that stock prices, interest rates, and measures of inflation expectations seem to vary\\nless in economies in which the central bank has an explicit long-run goal for inflation.\\nI suspect that this better anchoring of expectations and the success of inflation targeting in\\nmany countries is attributable in part to aspects of the political economy that David identified.\\nA formal inflation target represents a national embrace of a goal, in which elected authorities\\nrecognize the primacy of price stability and publicly support - indeed, even require - the\\ncentral bank's pursuit of that goal. To the extent that elected authorities channel the desires\\nof the electorate, a central bank directed to adopt an inflation target is being given a strong\\nsignal as to the goal's importance to the public at large. This affirmation has often been\\nreinforced by the granting of operational independence to the central bank to achieve that\\ngoal most effectively. An important effect of such public acceptance of price stability is that it\\nerodes the standing of those who would direct central bank action toward other ends. In such\\nan environment, workers, businesspeople, and investors can make plans with the\\nexpectation that nominal magnitudes will be predictable and so devote their attention to more\\nproductive matters.\\nFor the European Central Bank, this framework was established by treaty. In most other\\ninstances, the adoption of an inflation target involved laws and mutual understandings, not\\nconstitutional changes. The early adopters of inflation targets were parliamentary\\ndemocracies, which is not too surprising given that in such a system a single branch of\\ngovernment can enact laws and put them into effect. With regard to an inflation goal, the\\nparliament can erect the formal apparatus and the finance minister can serve as the\\ngovernment's point of contact with the central bank.\\nThe system in the United States is different in that two independent branches of government\\nare responsible for economic policy making, making agreement on a single goal problematic.\\nMoreover, those two branches have already spoken as to the appropriate aim of the nation's\\ncentral bank: The Congress, in a law the President signed, has given the Federal Reserve a\\ndual mandate that directs us to foster maximum employment and stable prices over time.\\nThis instruction is not an accident of history, in that, in the past, the Congress has shown no\\nappetite to amend its legislation. Nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual\\nmandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price\\nstability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of\\nresource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run. The dual\\nmandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having\\ninflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's\\npotential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those\\nassociated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.\\nAs I said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces\\nresources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal\\nmagnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output\\nwhile keeping inflation contained. The latter is particularly attractive given our dual mandate,\\nin that better-anchored inflation expectations could produce the win-win outcome of\\nimproving the attainment of both goals. For that reason, in its consideration of its\\ncommunications strategies, the Federal Open Market Committee has been discussing\\nwhether mechanisms could be put in place that could better anchor inflation expectations in a\\nmanner consistent with the institutional framework of our dual mandate.\\nThe second of David's open issues - whether central banks should lean against possible\\nasset price bubbles - was the key topic in my discussion here eighteen months ago, at\\nOtmar's festschrift. My answer then is my answer now. A central bank should focus on the\\noutlook for the macroeconomy and generally relegate asset prices to the subordinate role of\\ninputs to the forecast process. I view this as the simple application of humility that David and\\nI find so admirable. Although economic theory provides no settled answers to any topic, its\\npredictions are especially imprecise with regard to asset pricing, which has two implications\\nfor central bankers. First, little confidence can be attached to the determination that an asset\\nbubble exists except in the most extreme of circumstances. Second, even less confidence\\ncan be attached to predictions of the effects of policy on asset prices, and in particular on\\nany speculative element in those prices. Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a\\nperceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the\\neconomy more generally.\\nAs a result, my preferred policy framework remains three pronged: First, assign the single\\ninstrument of monetary policy to its macroeconomic objective; second, rely on regulation to\\nerect a resilient financial structure; and, third, in the event that market judgments prove to be\\nwrong and financial prices adjust sharply, apply the tool of monetary policy to the\\nmacroeconomic task at hand. That task is not always easily captured by simple statistical\\nregularities. Relationships between financial markets and economic results are complex and\\nnonlinear, especially when markets are not behaving normally. When investors are ebullient,\\ntheir expectations of outsized capital gains can feed on themselves and back on the\\neconomy. On the way down, investors' loss of confidence, a reduction in credit availability,\\nand a tightening of terms and conditions for credit have the potential to have pronounced\\neffects on activity and inflation.\\nThe world is, no doubt, different than when we gathered here eighteen months ago.\\nHowever, it is far too soon to pass judgment on what went wrong in the U.S. housing market\\nand why. I suspect that, when studies are done with cooler reflection, the causes of the\\nswing in house prices will be seen as less a consequence of monetary policy and more a\\nresult of the emotions of excessive optimism followed by fear experienced every so often in\\nthe marketplace through the ages. To some extent, too, the amplitude of the housing cycle\\nwas heightened by the newness of the subprime market, the fragmentation of regulatory\\noversight responsibility for that market, and the complexity and opacity of the newer\\ninstruments for transforming and distributing risk. Low policy interest rates early in this\\ndecade helped feed the initial rise in house prices. However, the worst excesses in the\\nmarket probably occurred when short-term rates were already well on their way to more\\nnormal levels, but longer-term rates were held down by a variety of forces. And similar,\\nsometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some\\neconomies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.\\nThe action the Federal Open Market Committee took this Tuesday can be interpreted as the\\napplication of the third leg of my preferred policy triad, in that it was taken \\\"to forestall some\\nof the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the\\ndisruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.\\\" In the past, such\\nefforts to cushion the restraint induced by declines in asset prices have fueled the assertion\\nthat Federal Reserve policy is asymmetrical in its response to booms and busts in asset\\nprices. Such an asymmetry is said to have the potential to feed \\\"moral hazard\\\" in that\\ninvestors would spend less effort evaluating underlying values as they were lulled by the\\nprotection they expected to be provided by monetary policy action.\\nIn point of fact, Federal Reserve policy makers have not been asymmetrical in intent or in\\nactions, in that we have always focused sharply on the macroeconomy. Asset prices have\\nmattered in the determination of policy because they have mattered for our outlook. I am\\nconfident that the federal funds rate would not have been as high in 2000 if it had not been\\nfor the level of equity prices that year, nor would the federal funds rate have been as\\nelevated in 2006 in the absence of the tight credit spreads, low term premiums, and the\\nimpetus from housing wealth. And I doubt policy would have been eased this week if housing\\nprices had continued their upward march. In each instance, however, policy was motivated\\nnot by the desire to achieve any particular level of asset prices, but rather by the Federal\\nReserve's assessment of how changes in asset prices were affecting the forecast of growth\\nand inflation.\\nI would also caution that a symmetrical response to the macroeconomic outlook will need to\\nreflect the inherent asymmetries in business cycles. In the typical boom-bust cycle, asset\\nprices tend to rise relatively gradually over a protracted period but fall sharply in a shorter\\nstretch of time, which financial economists refer to as \\\"rising by the escalator and falling by\\nthe elevator.\\\" Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key\\nmacroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern. It is not\\nsurprising then that a macro-focused monetary policy will leave an asymmetric footprint in\\nthe data.\\nIn the end, my humble advice is to evaluate policymakers relative to the tasks the law has\\ngiven them. In my judgment, the record over the past twenty-five years of steady growth with\\ntwo mild recessions and gradually declining inflation to a reasonably low level does not\\nbetray an asymmetry in our policy responses in the metric that counts - macroeconomic\\nperformance.\",\n          \"Susan Schmidt Bies: Economic outlook and developments in mortgage\\nmarkets\\nRemarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve\\nSystem, at the Eller College of Management Distinguished Speaker Series, Tucson, Arizona,\\n18 January 2007.\\n* * *\\nTo begin, I would like to thank Dean Portney and everyone at the Eller College of Management here at\\nThe University of Arizona for the invitation to speak this evening. I know that this audience includes\\nboth experienced business leaders as well as students preparing to apply the knowledge they have\\nlearned in the classroom to the real world. Accordingly, my remarks will first touch on the economic\\noutlook. Then, I will offer some thoughts on the challenges facing consumers as they navigate today's\\nchanging mortgage loan market.\\nEconomic outlook\\nEconomic activity slowed in the middle part of last year. After rising at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent\\nover the previous two years, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.6\\npercent in the second quarter of last year. Real GDP growth in the second half of last year slowed\\nafter accounting for some measurement difficulties in the automotive sector. Despite the recent\\nslowing in output, however, resource utilization remains relatively high by historical standards and thus\\ncontinues to be a potential source of upward pressure on inflation.\\nIn the aftermath of the 2001 recession, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased monetary\\npolicy substantially. However, the degree of easing in place in 2003 and 2004 was clearly\\nunsustainable. Since mid-2004, the FOMC has gradually moved monetary policy from an\\naccommodative stance to a more neutral position. As a consequence, the elements now appear to be\\nin place for some easing of resource utilization rates over the next year or so and a reduction in\\ninflationary pressures. However, substantial uncertainty surrounds the near-term outlook. In\\ndetermining the future path of interest rates, the FOMC will be guided by the incoming data on both\\noutput and prices, so let's begin by reviewing recent developments.\\nEconomic activity\\nThe slowdown in the growth of real GDP since last spring largely reflects a cooling of the housing\\nmarket: Sales of both new and existing homes dropped sharply after their peak in the summer of 2005,\\nthe inventory of unsold homes has soared, and the number of single-family and multifamily housing\\nstarts has fallen nearly 30 percent since the beginning of last year. At the same time, homes are\\nappreciating more slowly and in some markets prices are even declining.\\nNonetheless, a variety of factors should help limit any remaining contraction in housing demand. For\\nexample, despite the 4-1/4 percentage point increase in short-term interest rates over the past three\\nyears, the interest rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage has increased only about 1/2 percentage\\npoint, and borrowing costs continue to be relatively low. The ongoing growth in employment and real\\nincomes and the recent increase in the stock market wealth of households should also support the\\ndemand for housing. Indeed, the latest data on home sales and consumer homebuying attitudes\\nsuggest that the demand for housing may be stabilizing. While much of the downshift in the housing\\nmarket appears to have occurred already, some further softening in housing starts may yet lie ahead\\nas the inventory of unsold homes is reduced to appropriate levels.\\nThat said, it is encouraging that the recent weakness in residential construction does not appear to\\nhave spilled over to other sectors. For instance, employment has been growing nicely in nonresidential\\nconstruction, even as it has shrunk in the residential sector. In addition, consumer confidence currently\\nstands a good bit above its long-run average and consumption is still being fueled by past house-price\\ngains, which raised household wealth. This contrasts with previous slowdowns in the housing market,\\nwhich have typically coincided with widespread economic weakness.\\nAlthough the slowdown in the housing market has so far done little to reduce consumer outlays, other\\nfactors do appear to have had a damping effect. In particular, consumption likely was restrained earlier\\nthis year by the rise in energy prices, which took a large bite out of household budgets. The rise in\\nenergy prices over the past few years has also affected the auto sector, most notably by reducing the\\ndemand for gas-guzzling automobiles, such as sport-utility vehicles and trucks. As a result of this\\ndecreased demand and other factors, inventories of these types of vehicles rose in the second half of\\nlast year. In response, domestic automakers cut production. However, the latest data on auto sales\\nand scheduled new-vehicle production suggest that the drag from the inventory correction in this\\nsector may be easing.\\nOffsetting influences on consumption should support continued growth of consumer spending. The\\nslowing in the appreciation of house prices will likely reduce the impetus to consumer spending from\\nthis source, while recent increases in stock market values, declines in energy prices and strong\\nemployment and wage growth should spur consumption.\\nIn the business sector, spending on nonresidential construction has been particularly robust.\\nExpenditures on drilling and mining structures have increased rapidly in response to high prices for\\nnatural gas and crude oil. Investment in other types of structures, such as offices and commercial\\nbuildings, has also been strong. Data for October and November indicate that although the growth rate\\nof nonresidential investment moderated substantially in the fourth quarter of last year, it still remained\\nhealthy by historical standards.\\nSpending on equipment and software grew quite rapidly from mid-2004 to mid-2006, but appears to\\nhave advanced at a substantially slower pace in the second half of last year. The recent stepdown in\\nthe growth of business sales likely had a damping influence on capital spending, and, in fact, business\\nsentiment has moved down in the past year. However, some backlog of unfilled orders for capital\\ngoods such as industrial machinery and other types of heavy equipment remains, which should help\\nsupport spending in the near term. Moreover, the demand for information technology equipment is\\nlikely to be well maintained, in part because of the recent introduction of a new generation of\\nmicroprocessing chips and more-efficient large servers.\\nCurrent financial conditions are also supportive of business spending. Corporate balance sheets are\\nstrong and flush with cash, profits are strong, and broad stock price indexes are up appreciably since\\nthe beginning of last year. At the same time, yield spreads on corporate bonds across the ratings\\nspectrum have been low, supported by the strong balance sheets and robust profits.\\nInflation\\nWhat are the implications of current economic activity on inflation prospects? Consumer prices\\nexcluding food and energy accelerated through last summer - the core inflation rate was 2.4 percent\\nover the four quarters ending in the third quarter of last year, up from 2.0 percent for the same period a\\nyear before.1 The more recent monthly readings have been more favorable - core prices rose 2.2\\npercent over the twelve months through last November, only a touch higher than the 2.1 percent rise\\nover the previous twelve months, and this morning's latest figures on the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\nsuggest that this pattern continued into December. Nevertheless, the risk to inflation continues to be\\non the upside until we see further confirmation in this trend toward moderation.\\nIn thinking about the macroeconomic consequences of inflation, it makes sense to look at the core\\nrate, which excludes the prices of energy and food, when the focus is on the short run. This is because\\ntemporary shocks to food and energy prices typically don't translate into changes in inflationary\\npressure. However, if these shocks persist, they may have an effect on core inflation and, more\\ngenerally, on the economic behavior of households and businesses. Core inflation can be affected\\nwhen the price changes are propagated along the production chain - say from oil prices to the prices\\nof chemicals and ultimately to the prices of goods made with those chemicals. In addition, shocks to\\nfood and energy prices may affect inflation expectations. Thus, we also pay attention to broader\\nmeasures of inflation.\\nAll things considered, the scene appears to be set for a deceleration in prices. One contributing factor\\nis likely to be the slowing in economic activity I already discussed, which should ease the overall\\npressure on resources. Another important factor affecting the inflation outlook is household and\\nbusiness expectations for inflation. As best we can judge, inflation expectations appear to be well\\ncontained: Measures of longer-term inflation expectations, based on surveys and on a comparison of\\nyields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt, have remained within the ranges in which\\nthey have fluctuated in recent years. Finally, the recent decline in energy prices, if sustained, should\\nreduce cost pressures along the production chain.\\nBut a decline in the inflation rate is not assured. Outside of the housing and automotive sectors,\\ngrowth remains sound and labor markets remain tight, especially for skilled workers. The\\nunemployment rate began to decline in the second half of 2003 and by the fourth quarter of last year\\nstood at a relatively low 4-1/2 percent. With labor markets comparatively tight by historical standards,\\nunit labor costs have accelerated over the past year, and firms may pass on some of these higher\\ncosts to consumers. However, strong business profit margins, which are currently well above their\\nhistorical averages, could act as a shock absorber if cost strains were to intensify. All told, in my\\njudgment, inflation appears poised to decelerate in coming months as energy prices stabilize and\\nresource pressures ease. But the risks to that outlook seem tilted toward the upside.\\nThe Federal Reserve and consumer protection\\nMy remarks on the economic outlook discussed developments in housing markets, but now I would\\nlike to delve into a specific area of mortgage lending: consumer awareness and understanding of\\nchanges in mortgage markets. Given its role as the central bank, a banking supervisor, and a\\nconsumer protection regulator for financial services, the Federal Reserve takes a multifaceted\\napproach to understanding the consumer financial services market. Thus, we recognize the\\nimportance of homeownership in building household wealth and we monitor the safety and soundness\\nof mortgage underwriting practices. We also write regulations that help ensure consumers understand\\nthe characteristics of financial services and products and that they receive the protections available for\\nthese services and products.\\nSince the 1960s, Congress has enacted several laws to ensure that consumers receive\\ncomprehensive information and fair treatment in a broad range of financial transactions. These laws\\nprotect consumers in transactions involving credit and debit card accounts; automated teller machine\\ntransactions and other electronic fund transfers; deposit account activities; automobile leases;\\nmortgages and home equity loans; and lines of credit and other unsecured credit. Congress has\\nassigned the Federal Reserve a considerable role in ensuring that consumers are protected under\\nthese laws. For example, the Federal Reserve writes rules to implement the Truth in Lending Act,\\nwhich Congress enacted to ensure that consumers receive clear information about credit terms and\\ncosts. The Federal Reserve is also responsible for rules that implement fair lending laws, such as the\\nEqual Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits discrimination in credit transactions. In addition, we work\\nwith other federal agencies to write joint rules, for example, to ensure that consumers' financial privacy\\nis protected.\\nThe Federal Reserve also examines state member banks and foreign banking organizations and\\nexercises its umbrella supervisory authority with respect to bank and financial holding companies to\\naddress compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. The Federal Reserve is\\ncommitted to vigorous enforcement of those laws.\\nFurther, the Federal Reserve develops consumer education materials, recognizing that well-educated\\nconsumers are better able to protect themselves in financial transactions. Clearly, to choose wisely\\nfrom the variety of products and providers available, consumers must have the financial knowledge to\\nnavigate today's increasingly complex financial services marketplace.\\nFor example, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision just revised the Consumer\\nHandbook on Adjustable Rate Mortgages (CHARM) to include additional information about\\nnontraditional mortgage products. The CHARM booklet is an important means for delivering\\ninformation about alternative adjustable rate mortgage products to consumers because creditors are\\nrequired to provide a copy of the booklet to each consumer who receives an application for an ARM.\\nBecause the booklet is provided at this early stage in the process, it can be useful in encouraging\\nconsumers to ask brokers and lenders the right questions to decide if this type of loan is right for them.\\nThe booklet explains such features as payment shock and negative amortization. It also provides\\nnumerical examples that illustrate how consumers' payments can change and how their loan balances\\nmay increase over the term of the loan.\\nThe Federal Reserve also published a consumer education brochure titled: Interest-Only Mortgage\\nPayments and Option-Payment ARMs --Are They for You? The brochure is designed to assist\\nconsumers who are shopping for a mortgage loan and is available in printed form and in electronic\\nform on the Federal Reserve's website, along with other consumer mortgage information\\nFinally, the Federal Reserve engages in numerous outreach activities and conducts research to help\\nus better understand the financial services market and consumer behavior and the best approaches\\nfor assisting consumers. We sponsor consumer and industry surveys, hold public hearings, discuss\\nissues with our Consumer Advisory Council, and conduct consumer focus groups and other types of\\nconsumer testing, in addition to considering the public comments on proposed rules.\\nRecently, the Federal Reserve has engaged in outreach to a broad group of interested parties\\nregarding nontraditional mortgages. Our Consumer Advisory Council, which includes consumer\\nadvocates and industry representatives, provided us with valuable information about nontraditional\\nmortgage products during development of the interagency guidance. In addition, the Federal Reserve\\nheld a series of four public hearings on home-equity lending during the summer of 2006. One of the\\nprincipal purposes of the hearings was to gather information to inform the Federal Reserve's review of\\nits Truth in Lending rules. A significant portion of the hearings was devoted to discussing nontraditional\\nmortgage products, and in particular, whether consumers receive adequate information about these\\nproducts. The hearings explored research on consumer behavior in shopping for mortgage loans and\\nincluded discussions about the challenges in designing disclosures to more effectively communicate\\nloan terms and risks to consumers. We will consider this information in developing plans and\\nrecommendations for revising the Truth in Lending rules, which require all creditors to provide\\nconsumers with disclosures about loan terms.\\nMany financial products are very sophisticated credit transactions, and the disclosures describing\\nthem are also complex and highly technical; which can be difficult for some consumers to understand.\\nTo address this issue, the Federal Reserve is focusing in a more rigorous way on determining the\\neffectiveness of disclosures. We conduct extensive consumer testing to determine what information is\\nmost important to consumers, when it is most useful for consumers to receive it, what language and\\nformats work best, and how disclosures can be simplified, and better organized, to reduce complexity\\nand information overload. To that end, the Federal Reserve uses design consultants to assist in\\ndeveloping model disclosures that are most likely to be effective in communicating vital credit\\ninformation to consumers. The Federal Reserve also uses consumer testing to assist in developing\\nmodel disclosure forms, and we draw from research done by respected behavioral economists.\\nFor example, when considering some regulatory changes related to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act,\\nthe Federal Reserve used consumer focus group testing to develop useful and timely disclosures for\\nemployees whose pay is received in the form of a payroll card (a card that works much like a\\ntraditional debit card). The Federal Reserve is also engaging in extensive consumer testing of credit\\ncard disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act, and has found those interactions with\\nconsumers instructive in revising disclosures to be more meaningful to consumers in today's complex\\nand highly prolific credit card market.\\nMortgage lending\\nI now want to discuss developments in mortgage loan products. Last September, the federal financial\\ninstitution regulators issued supervisory guidance on nontraditional mortgages. These mortgages\\ninclude interest-only loans that allow consumers to defer the payment of principal and make only\\ninterest payments for an initial period. They also include adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with a\\npayment option, allowing consumers to make \\\"minimum payments\\\" of less than the accrued interest.\\nThe result of such a loan structure is that the amount owed can increase even as the borrower makes\\npayments, a circumstance known as negative amortization. Over time, the payments for these loans\\nmust be adjusted upward to catch up with fully indexed interest rates and/or paydowns (amortization)\\nof the balance owed, often significantly, which sometimes results in what some call \\\"payment shock.\\\"\\nSometimes borrowers can refinance out of these loans, but that may cost them a serious prepayment\\npenalty and reduce the amount of equity that they have built up in their home. The complexity of these\\nproducts contrasts with traditional thirty-year fixed-rate loans, in which consumers have equal monthly\\npayments that are sufficient to cover the accrued interest and pay down the principal, and with which\\nborrowers are generally familiar.\\nTo be clear, nontraditional mortgages certainly serve a useful purpose when used appropriately.\\nThese products have increased the range of financing options available to consumers and have grown\\nin popularity over the past few years. Some consumers may benefit from these products' more flexible\\npayment options. For example, consumers with seasonal or irregular income or who expect their\\nincomes to increase are more likely to be able to absorb the increase in payments in the near term of\\nthe loan.\\nBut nontraditional mortgage loan products can be complex and may not be appropriate for everyone.\\nConcerns have been raised that consumers are not getting clear and balanced information about the\\nrisks and features of interest-only and payment option ARMs. These products have been advertised\\nand promoted based on their initially low monthly payments when compared with traditional mortgage\\nproducts. By focusing on initial monthly payments without appropriate understanding of how the\\npayments can vary over time or that minimum payments may actually increase the amount owed,\\nmany consumers have become financially overextended.\\nMortgage lenders are no longer limited in the size of their mortgage lending activities by the amount of\\navailable funding on their balance sheets. Mortgages are now routinely sold to institutions who\\nsecuritize mortgages by aggregating them with other loans into pools. These mortgage-backed\\nsecurities are held by banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and other investors both in the United\\nStates and internationally. This diversity of funding sources makes it possible for lenders to structure\\nproducts that meet the various needs of borrowers, and still be able to mitigate the risks they may take\\non if the loan were held on their balance sheets. As a result, the mortgage lending industry continually\\nadapts to consumer requirements and investor preferences for loan securitization structures.\\nA mortgage is generally the largest financial obligation a consumer enters into. The initial costs, the\\ncost over the life of the mortgage, and the costs to prepay and refinance can be significant. Having a\\nwide variety of mortgage types assists consumers in finding a way to finance the purchase of a home\\nthat best meets their own financial and lifestyle requirements. But the growing complexity of products\\nmakes it a bigger challenge for borrowers to understand the characteristics of competing products.\\nThis is where shopping among a couple of lenders and a couple of different products can help the\\nconsumer understand the features of different loan types.\\nWhen looking at different loan products, consumers should consider how long they plan to own their\\nhome, expectations of future income, their stage of life cycle, and broader financial obligations in\\nchoosing among mortgage alternatives. For example, if consumers want to pay off their mortgages\\nbefore retirement, they must determine if the monthly payment will fully amortize the loan by the target\\ndate. If homeowners plan to move in three years, then they should compare prepayment penalties, if\\nany, and interest rates among their mortgage alternatives.\\nBut some consumers do not actively shop for a lender or a mortgage, and they do not compare loan\\nterms in light of their personal circumstances. Instead they rely on one lender and accept the\\nmortgage loan presented to them. Mortgages that are appropriate for one borrower, however, may\\ncreate problems for another. For example, some mortgages have low initial interest rates and monthly\\npayments. But increases come later as the \\\"teaser period\\\" ends and payments rise to begin pay down\\nof principal. Borrowers whose budgets make the initial payment just manageable may have difficulty\\nmeeting these significant jumps in monthly payments and so are at risk of defaulting on their\\nmortgages and losing their home.\\nBy shopping among lenders and products, consumers are also better able to determine whether a\\ngiven loan feature is really an advantage. For example, some lenders have recently been more willing\\nto waive proof of income when making a mortgage. But, they may charge a higher interest rate to\\ncover the risk that the borrower may not be able to afford the mortgage. The customer however may\\nsave interest cost by making the effort to provide copies of tax returns and pay stubs. Another\\nexample is that some lenders do not require their borrowers to pay their property tax and hazard\\ninsurance premiums into an escrow account. Consumers need to ask lenders if their monthly\\npayments will include funds for such an escrow account. If not, borrowers need to separately set aside\\nsavings to meet these obligations.\\nLenders, for their part, should make it possible for consumers to engage in shopping for a mortgage.\\nAs I noted, last September the federal financial institution regulators issued interagency guidance on\\nnontraditional mortgage products, which included both a focus on safe and sound lending practices as\\nwell as on consumer awareness and consumer protection. The guidance focuses on the responsibility\\nof lenders to provide consumers with clear and balanced information at crucial decision-making points\\nabout the benefits and risks of nontraditional mortgage products. Accordingly, the interagency\\nguidance describes recommended practices for financial institutions in communicating with consumers\\nwhile they are shopping, not just upon submission of an application or at loan consummation.\\nSpecifically, the guidance recommends that institutions' promotional materials and descriptions of\\nthese products include information about, among other things, potential increases in consumers'\\npayment obligations and the potential consequences of increasing principal loan balances and\\ndecreasing home equity. The guidance also recommends that institutions alert consumers to the\\namount of any prepayment penalty that may be imposed if the consumer refinances the mortgage.\\nConclusion\\nI hope that my remarks today provided a useful snapshot of the current economic outlook. Outside of\\nhousing and the automotive sector, the economy is strong and employment is growing. The surge in\\nhousing construction that occurred in 2004-2005 was not sustainable, and we are now well along in\\nadjusting housing construction to more comfortable levels.\\nInflation continues to run at a pace above my comfort level. The Federal Reserve has raised interest\\nrates to moderate inflation. Monetary policy works with long lags and so the economy is still reacting to\\nour past actions. Given the strong growth in most sectors of the economy, the risks to inflation are still\\non the upside. In addition to giving some thoughts on the economy, I felt it was useful to offer a\\nsummary of the role that the Federal Reserve plays in consumer protection, using the current example\\nof nontraditional mortgages. Clearly, the Federal Reserve believes in promoting consumer awareness\\nand maintaining consumer protection so that users of financial products fully understand those\\nproducts and their associated risks.\",\n          \"Thomas C Baxter: Compliance - some thoughts about reaching the next\\nlevel\\nRemarks by Mr Thomas C Baxter, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the\\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Fordham Journal of Corporate Counsel &\\nFinancial Law Symposium, Fordham Law School, New York City, 9 February 2015.\\n* * *\\nThese remarks are personal and do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of\\nNew York, or any component of the Federal Reserve System.\\nIntroduction\\nLet me begin by thanking Professor Sean Griffith, the director of the Corporate Law Center,\\nand Robert Lyons, editor of the Fordham Journal of Corporate & Financial Law, for inviting\\nme to participate in this symposium about corporate compliance and corporate governance.\\nLet me also thank Fordham Law School for hosting the symposium. I would also like to\\nrecognize a colleague who is with us today. He is Martin Grant, who is the New York Fed's\\nchief ethics and compliance officer. I have had the privilege of working with Martin for the last\\n25 years, and much of what I have learned about compliance I have learned from him.\\nIn the space sometimes labeled compliance, we have come a very long way in a relatively\\nshort time. In about 20 years, compliance has transformed from a nice idea to an important\\ncomponent of most major corporations. This is especially true in the highly regulated\\nindustries, including the industry where I have made my career, financial services. We could\\nspend much time discussing how this transformation happened. From my vantage point, it\\nhappened because of the combined effects of the Federal sentencing guidelines, the\\nDelaware Chancery Court's Caremark decision,1 and the post-Enron legislation known as\\nSarbanes Oxley. Of course, other events also fueled the transformation, and in the financial\\nservices industry, the worst financial crisis our country has seen since the Great Depression\\nbecame a burning platform.\\nWhile it is always important to look back at the road traveled, I am not going to spend any\\nmore time on that particular topic. Instead, today I intend to look forward at where\\ncompliance is going, and to forecast for our future some things we should pay attention to\\nnow. I will discuss five different items, and I predict that some of the greatest\\naccomplishments for compliance are not in the recent past but in the not-too-distant future. If\\nwe plan ahead, and if we can successfully adapt to changing circumstances in our respective\\nindustries and in the national and global economies, then 20 years from now you will listen to\\nanother keynote speaker remarking on further amazing progress for the compliance\\nprofession. In short, we are on our way to another level.\\nImportant steps toward the next level\\nMost of my remarks today will be devoted to the things that I believe will get us to the next\\nlevel. Let me turn to them now.\\n1. Ethics and compliance/values and rules\\nThe nomenclature that is used in compliance to describe the company officer responsible for\\ncompliance has changed, and the change in nomenclature is a clue to revealing a material,\\nsubstantive change. Twenty years ago, we called this officer the \\\"compliance officer\\\", and I\\nemphasize the singular. Over several years the title morphed, as compliance programs\\ndeveloped and compliance jobs multiplied, both with respect to subject matter expertise and\\nthe types of skill sets needed to make compliance programs \\\"take\\\". Consequently,\\ncompanies found that the compliance officer turned into the chief compliance officer,\\nbecause in major companies, it took a village to get compliance done. Compliance, you see,\\nturned from singular to plural.\\nMore recently the title has again changed. In many companies today, the title is chief ethics\\nand compliance officer, or CECO, reflecting a salutary trend on the part of many companies\\nto integrate ethics and compliance. Why is this happening? In my view, it is happening in\\nrecognition of the fact that it is easier to have an effective compliance program in a company\\nthat nurtures a strong ethical culture. In a recent speech, Daniel Tarullo, a governor of the\\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, accurately observed that \\\"culture\\\" is a\\n\\\"somewhat contested academic concept\\\". Yet, the evidence is growing that an ethical culture\\nproduces tangible benefits, including making compliance more effective.\\nRecent studies attempting to assess the effectiveness of compliance programs have\\ndeveloped a measure called the \\\"PEI\\\", or Program Effectiveness Index. Early work with the\\nPEI shows that companies combining their ethics and compliance programs tend to have\\nbetter PEI scores. The reason for the higher effectiveness measure seems to be something\\nthat I find perfectly rational. Ethics programs, consisting of measures taken to inculcate\\norganizational values, help to create a culture that is not only conducive to following rules\\nthat are embedded in law and regulation, but also conducive to compliance with company\\nmores. A strong ethical culture breeds a more compliant culture.\\nThe symbiotic relationship between ethics and compliance arises because of the close\\nconnection between values and rules. Ethics is about values and compliance is about rules.\\nYou obtain the beneficial symbiotic effect when the values and the rules live in harmony. A\\ndifferent result is obtained when you have organizational values that conflict with the rules.\\nOne of the very exciting areas in compliance today relates to how a company's strong ethical\\nculture can impact corporate behavior. One aspect of this behavioral change relates to the\\ngreater tendency of corporate constituents to follow the applicable rules when the culture is\\nright. Looking to the future, I envision we will see much more empirical research that shows\\nthe benefits of merging ethics with compliance, and placing both in the hands of a trusted\\ncorporate officer with a catchy new name - the chief ethics and compliance officer. As we\\nmove to the next level, ethics and compliance will increasingly become a part of a single\\nprogram.\\n2. Ethics and compliance as a tool for on-boarding risk\\nThe last 20 years have demonstrated the benefit of ethics and compliance in identifying legal\\nrisk and taking operational measures to keep that identified legal risk within the\\norganization's accepted risk appetite. In most applications, though, compliance has been the\\nvehicle that prompts the organization to reduce risk by constraining activity. In the financial\\nservices industry, correspondent banking provides an illustrative case.\\nCorrespondent banking is the business of effecting funds transfers for other financial\\ninstitutions. Because the U.S. dollar is the international medium of exchange, financial\\ninstitutions throughout the world have a need to effect dollar-denominated transfers of funds.\\nEthics and compliance professionals in U.S. banks have pointed out that this type of\\nbusiness presents several different legal risks: money laundering, terrorist financing, and\\nsanctions evasion are the most obvious and the most notorious. There is no doubt that these\\ncompliance professionals are correct. One consequence of their being right, however, is that\\nU.S. correspondent banks decided to \\\"de-risk\\\". To execute on the de-risking mandate, many\\nU.S. correspondents stopped providing correspondent banking services to those perceived\\nto present such risk.\\nAs a result, certain elements of the global financial services industry now find it increasingly\\ndifficult to transact business in dollars. There is a concern by the U.S. correspondents\\ntransferring funds for Middle Eastern customers that the correspondents might unwittingly be\\nproviding services to a terrorist organization, or be enabling a person or affected sovereign to\\nevade economic sanctions. So, the correspondents close accounts for all banks in the Middle\\nEast. Similarly, there is a concern by the U.S. correspondents transferring funds for Latin\\nAmerican customers that they might unwittingly be providing financial services to drug\\ntraffickers, a money laundering risk. So, they close accounts for all banks located in Mexico,\\nVenezuela and Colombia. The de-risking exercise succeeds in its risk-reducing objective, but\\nit succeeds in an overly broad manner by cutting services indiscriminately to so many.\\nThe adverse and unintended consequences for certain regions of the world are clear and\\npresent. There are also implications for U.S. policy with respect to the role of the dollar as the\\ninternational medium of exchange. These issues, while highly consequential, are not the\\nobject of my remarks today; rather, they are a symptom of what compliance can lead to -\\nnamely, a reason to restrict business activity. Given the size of penalties for violations, and\\nthe potential reputational damage associated with this business, it is very difficult to quarrel\\nwith the business judgment.\\nThe success of compliance over the last 20 years has conditioned business leaders to think\\nabout compliance as a pathway to terminate or constrain a risky business relationship.\\nHowever, it is possible to look at compliance in a very different way, as a two-way street and\\nnot a \\\"one-way\\\" street. Let me explain what I mean. A sound and effective compliance\\nprogram can be used, appropriately in my view, as a tool that would permit on-boarding of\\nwhat is seen as risky business.\\nTo continue with the example of correspondent banking, if a U.S. correspondent had a sound\\nand effective compliance program that was well tailored to identify and control the risks of\\nmoney laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion, this correspondent might\\nbecome sufficiently confident to on-board risk. This means that instead of closing accounts\\nfor everyone in a specific geographic area, it would continue with some of these accounts, or\\neven open new accounts. Now, I do not want anyone to think I am saying that all\\ncorrespondents can reasonably have such confidence now. At this point in our journey, I\\nconcede the need to develop greater confidence that the identified risks can be controlled at\\na reasonable cost. With that said, I believe that we will reach a place where ethics and\\ncompliance programs are sufficiently developed so organizations can make considered\\ndecisions to on-board risk and keep it within the accepted risk appetite by using effective\\ncontrols. I look forward to that time as we move to the next level.\\n3. Developing the methodology to assess effectiveness\\nI mentioned earlier one of the promising new tools to assess the effectiveness of ethics and\\ncompliance programs, and that is the PEI, the Program Effectiveness Index. The excellent\\nreport by the Ethics Resource Center, The Federal Sentencing Guidelines For Organizations\\nat Twenty Years, has drawn attention to standards for assessing program effectiveness. The\\nreport states: \\\"Altogether, the lack of assessment standards and guidance on how the quality\\nof a compliance/ethics program should influence the outcome of a matter create the\\nimpression, validated by the [Ethics Resource Center] and Conference Board studies...that\\ntoo many judgments are being made inside a black box.\\\"2\\nWhile we seem to be on the cusp of a number of promising indicators, like the PEI, the truth\\nis that we are not there yet. We simply do not have a tool that will give us an accurate and\\nreliable measure of program effectiveness. Instead, we have a situation where enforcers\\n(including those agencies with civil enforcement authority, such as the banking agencies)\\ntend to be result oriented. When we see that a particular organization has experienced a\\nmajor compliance failure, we tend to view the failure as evidence of the ineffectiveness of the\\nethics and compliance program. We reason backward, \\\"if the program were effective, this\\nwould not have happened.\\\" I think this is natural and understandable for the enforcement\\ncommunity, but it is not necessarily good policy. To borrow an observation from Senator Ted\\nKennedy concerning the Federal sentencing guidelines, this creates \\\"a risk that companies\\nwithout substantial compliance programs will get a free ride, and those with strong programs\\nwill not receive the credit that they deserve.\\\"3\\nAlternatively, if there were a reliable and acceptable measure of program effectiveness, this\\nkind of backward reasoning would be replaced by reliance on the effective measure.\\nInstitutions could use the measure when making arguments for leniency, again assuming\\nthat the measure demonstrated that their programs were effective. It might, of course, show\\njust the opposite. And there are other, perhaps even more important, benefits. If an industry\\nand its regulators came to have great confidence in a particular effectiveness measure, this\\nmight provide a foundation for building a program that could be used to on-board risk. Put\\ndifferently, a particular organization could have confidence that its ethics and compliance\\nprogram would be protective because the program had been validated by a well-accepted\\nmeasure of effectiveness.\\nSome of the skeptics will say \\\"you are dreaming\\\". When I hear them, I am reminded of the\\nwords of George Bernard Shaw, and specifically the reminder to dream things that never\\nwere and ask \\\"why not\\\".4\\n4. Adaptive compliance - adding speed and agility to process and procedure\\nOver the past 20 years, as ethics and compliance has moved through infancy and into early\\nchildhood, we have become committed to the process and procedure that is emblematic of a\\nprogram. There is much about this progression that is good. The building of compliance\\nprograms has produced real benefits,5 and these benefits have created the compliance\\nprofession. There is a risk too. The risk is that the process and procedure that is the\\nsubstance of the compliance program will become a kind of iron cage, restraining innovation\\nso that the organization cannot adapt to changing circumstances. In short, the process and\\nprocedure can stifle speed and agility.\\nOne place where this has occurred recently is in financial services. Some institutions\\nwitnessed some malefactors violating the law and engaging in anti-competitive practices with\\nrespect to the setting of the Libor rate. Those institutions responded to very specific rate\\nfixing abuses, but they did not envision that the abuses with respect to Libor could also be\\noccurring in other businesses, like foreign exchange. Compliance, in this particular instance,\\nwas not adaptive. Compliance professionals, in this instance, did not show the needed speed\\nand agility. They did not reason along the lines that \\\"if it is happening concerning Libor then it\\nmight be happening concerning foreign exchange.\\\"\\nAs compliance becomes increasingly routinized and subject to what the consultants would\\ncall the \\\"repeatable process\\\", the process can have a tendency to drive out creative thought.\\nAs creativity dissipates, so does the ability to connect related occurrences. In the next\\n20 years, we will need simultaneously to perform repeatable processes and to think\\ninnovatively. We will need to continue to build the routines and repeatable processes. Yet,\\nwe will also need to be sufficiently flexible to see around corners, to where new problems are\\nemerging, and new risks to our franchises are developing. This is what it will take to be\\nsuccessful at the next level.\\n5. Attention at the top - developing protocols for escalation\\nI commend Fordham for focusing this symposium on compliance and governance. They are\\nrelated and intertwined. The four items discussed all relate to compliance. My last item\\ntouches on governance.\\nAs I speak with chief ethics and compliance officers, a regular topic of conversation is conflict\\nwith the business leaders who own the risk. This is a little unsettling, because during the last\\n20 years we have been successful in establishing as a better practice the approval of the\\ncompliance program by the board of directors. One might think that, if the board of directors\\napproves the compliance program, then it should not be difficult for the chief ethics and\\ncompliance officer to get the business owners to pay close attention.\\nThe devil here, as in so many other places, lies in the details. It is usually the implementation\\nof the compliance program that causes the conflict. It is usually related to the cost of\\ncompliance, because the cost ordinarily affects how the business owner measures success,\\nwhich is the size of the business' profit. The chief ethics and compliance officer will not be\\nable to resolve the conflict easily, because compliance is a cost to the business which can\\nmake compliance the adversary of the business owner. The chief ethics and compliance\\nofficer will not want to bring a specific conflict issue to the attention of the board of directors.\\nWhile this might be very effective in resolving the specific conflict, it could absolutely destroy\\nher ability to function effectively thereafter. In a recent survey of chief ethics and compliance\\nofficers conducted by Price Waterhouse, the survey respondents identified as a problem their\\n\\\"struggle to gain the attention of the board of directors.\\\"6 Two specific issues were identified.\\nOne related to fear on the part of the chief ethics and compliance officer to engage in action\\nto resolve a conflict with a key business person - a fear of losing one's job or her place in the\\ncorporate hierarchy. The other problem concerned access to the board of directors. It is one\\nthing to go before the board of directors annually to have the compliance program approved.\\nIt is quite another to go before the board of directors to do battle with a senior executive who\\nis probably before the board of directors on a regular basis.\\nOne possible solution as we move to the next level is to embed ethics and compliance issues\\nin the disciplines that are more typical of governance issues involving the board of directors.\\nThese would be issues like strategy, business goals, and risk management, all of which\\ntouch ethics and compliance. Another solution would be to create escalation pathways to the\\nboard of directors for resolving conflicts between the chief ethics and compliance officer and\\na senior business leader.\\nConclusion\\nAs I said at the outset, ethics and compliance have come a long way in a very short time. We\\nhave learned a great deal during the journey. As I look out over the road ahead, I believe we\\nwill continue to make significant progress in business organizations that deliver on their value\\nproposition, not only to shareholders, but to the other constituents that these organizations\\nserve, their customers, employees, and communities. Ethics and compliance will be an\\nimportant part of that progress, provided that ethics and compliance is nurtured by a strong\\nethical culture, in a company following sound corporate governance, and employing the best\\nand the brightest personnel. I am excited about the road ahead.\\nThank you for listening.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n
